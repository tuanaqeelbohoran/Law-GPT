Introduction  
The Home Secretary has made changes in the Rules laid down by him as to the practice to be followed in the

contains the Rules as changed and replaces the provisions of HC 251 (as amended).  
2. Immigration Officers, Entry Clearance Officers and all staff of the Home Office Immigration and Nationality

the provisions of HC 251, as amended, as if these Rules had not been made.

5. Save where expressly indicated, these Rules do not a pply to those persons who are entitled to enter or remain 
in the United Kingdom by virtue of the provisions of the 2006 EEA Regulations. But any person who is not entitled 
to rely on the provisions of those Regulations is covered by these Rules.  
Interpreta tion 
6. In these Rules the following interpretations apply:  
""the Immigration Acts'  has the same meaning as it has in the Interpretation Act 1978.

""the 2006 EEA Regulations "" means the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006  
""adoption "" unless the contrary intention appears, includes a de facto adoption in accordance with the 
requirements of paragraph 309A of these Rules, and ""adop ted"" and ""adoptive parent"" should be construed 
accordingly.  
In Appendix FM references to 'application for leave to remain'  include an application for variation of leave to 
enter or remain of a person in the UK.

Common Tr avel Area 
15. The United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Republic of Ireland collectively form a 
common travel area. A person who has been examined for the purpose of immigration control at the point at 
which he entered the area does not normally require leave to enter any other part of it. However certain persons 
subject to the Immigration (Control of Entry through the Republic of Ireland) Order 1972 (as amended) who enter 
the United Kingdom through the Republic of Ireland do require leave to enter. This includes:

(ii) persons requiring visas;   
(iii) persons who entered the Republic of Ireland unlawfully;   
(iv) persons who are subject to directions given by the Secretary of State for their exclusion from the United

(i) a British Dependent Territories citizen;   
(ii) a British National (Overseas);   
(iii) a British Overseas citizen;   
(iv) a British protected person;   
Archived(v) a British subject by virtue of Section 30(a) of the British Nationality Act 1981, (who, immediately before the 
commencement of the 1981 Act would have been a British subject not possessing citizenship of the United 
Kingdom and Colonies or the citizen ship of any other Commonwealth country or territory).   
17. British Overseas citizens who hold United Kingdom passports wherever issued and who satisfy the 
Immigration Officer that they have, since 1 March 1968, been given indefinite leave to enter or remai n in the 
United Kingdom may be given indefinite leave to enter.  
Persons outside the United Kingdom  
17A. Where a person is outside the United Kingdom but wishes to travel to the United Kingdom an Immigration 
Officer may give or refuse him leave to enter. An  Immigration Officer may exercise these powers whether or not 
he is, himself, in the United Kingdom. However, an Immigration Officer is not obliged to consider an application 
for leave to enter from a person outside the United Kingdom.  
17B. Where a person having left the common travel area, has leave to enter the United Kingdom which remains 
in force under article 13 of the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000, an Immigration Officer may 
cancel that leave. An Immigration Officer may exercise t hese powers whether or not he is, himself, in the United 
Kingdom. If a person outside the United Kingdom has leave to remain in the United Kingdom which is in force in 
this way, the Secretary of State may cancel that leave.  
Returning Residents  
18. A person  seeking leave to enter the United Kingdom as a returning resident may be admitted for settlement 
provided the Immigration Officer is satisfied that the person concerned:  
(i) had indefinite leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom when he last left; and  
(ii) has not been away from the United Kingdom for more than 2 years; and   
(iii) did not receive assistance from public funds towards the cost of leaving the United Kingdom; and   
(iv) now seeks admission for the purpose of settlement.   
19. A person wh o does not benefit from the preceding paragraph by reason only of having been away from the 
United Kingdom too long may nevertheless be admitted as a returning resident if, for example, he has lived here 
for most of his life.  
19A. Where a person who has in definite leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom accompanies, on a tour 
of duty abroad, a spouse, civil partner, unmarried partner or same -sex partner who is a member of HM Forces 
serving overseas, or a permanent member of HM Diplomatic Service, or a comparable United Kingdom -based 
staff member of the British Council, or a staff member of the Department for International Development who is a 
British Citizen or is settled in the United Kingdom, sub -paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of paragraph 18 shall not a pply.  
20. The leave of a person whose stay in the United Kingdom is subject to a time limit lapses on his going to a 
country or territory outside the common travel area if the leave was given for a period of six months or less or 
conferred by a visit visa.  In other cases, leave lapses on the holder remaining outside the United Kingdom for a 
Archivedcontinuous period of more than two years. A person whose leave has lapsed and who returns after a temporary 
absence abroad within the period of this earlier leave has no  claim to admission as a returning resident. His 
application to re -enter the United Kingdom should be considered in the light of all the relevant circumstances. 
The same time limit and any conditions attached will normally be reimposed if he meets the requ irements of 
these Rules, unless he is seeking admission in a different capacity from the one in which he was last given leave 
to enter or remain.  
Non-lapsing leave  
20A. Leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom will usually lapse on the holder going t o a country or 
territory outside the common travel area. However, under article 13 of the Immigration (Leave to Enter and 
Remain) Order 2000 such leave will not lapse where it was given for a period exceeding six months or where it 
was conferred by means o f an entry clearance (other than a visit visa).  
Holders of restricted travel documents and passports  
21. The leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom of the holder of a passport or travel document whose 
permission to enter another country has to be e xercised before a given date may be restricted so as to terminate 
at least 2 months before that date.  
22. If his passport or travel document is endorsed with a restriction on the period for which he may remain 
outside his country of normal residence, his l eave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom may be limited so as 
not to extend beyond the period of authorised absence.  
23. The holder of a travel document issued by the Home Office should not be given leave to enter or remain for a 
period extending beyo nd the validity of that document. This paragraph and paragraphs 21 -22 do not apply to a 
person who is eligible for admission for settlement or to a spouse or civil partner who is eligible for admission 
under paragraph 282 or to a person who qualifies for t he removal of the time limit on his stay.  
Leave to enter granted on arrival in the United Kingdom

period not exceeding 6 months for a purpose for which prior entry clearance is not required under these Rules 
may be granted such leave, for a period not exceeding 6 months. This paragraph does not apply where the 
person is a British National (Overseas), a British overseas territories citizen, a Bri tish Overseas citizen, a British 
protected person, or a person who under the British Nationality Act 1981 is a British subject.

entry, for a period not exceeding 6 months.

with a United Ki ngdom entry clearance issued to him for the purpose for which he seeks entry:

Overseas citizen, a British protected pers on or a person who under the British Nationality Act 1981 is a British 
subject) who is seeking entry for a period exceeding six months or is seeking entry for a purpose for which prior 
entry clearance is required under these Rules.   
Such a person will be r efused leave to enter if he has no such current entry clearance. Any other person who 
wishes to ascertain in advance whether he is eligible for admission to the United Kingdom may apply for the 
issue of an entry clearance.  
25. Entry clearance takes the for m of a visa (for visa nationals) or an entry certificate (for non visa nationals).

accordingly accepted as ""entry clearances"" within the meaning of the Immigration Act 1971.  
25A. An entry clearance which satisfies the requirements set out in article 3 of the Immigration (Leave to Enter

applicant. Subject to paragrapgh 28A, any other application must be made to the post in the country or territory 
where the applicant is living which has been designated by the Secretary of State to accept applicat ions for entry 
clearance for that purpose and from that category of applicant. Where there is no such post the applicant must

condition which may interfere with his ability to support himself or his dependants, the Immigration Officer should

deciding whether a person seeking entry for private medical treatment has sufficient means at his d isposal.  
38. A returning resident should not be refused leave to enter or have existing leave to enter or remain cancelled 
on medical grounds. But where a person would be refused leave to enter or have existing leave to enter or 
remain cancelled on medical  grounds if he were not a returning resident or in any case where it is decided on 
compassionate grounds not to exercise the power to refuse leave to enter or to cancel existing leave to enter or 
Archivedremain, or in any other case where the Medical Inspector so recommends, the Immigration Officer should give 
the person concerned a notice requiring him to report to the Medical Officer of Environmental Health designated 
by the Medical Inspector with a view to further examination and any necessary treatment.

Part 11 - Asylum  
326A. Procedure  
The procedure s set out in these Rules shall apply to the consideration of asylum and humanitarian protection.  
Archived326B. Where the Secretary of State is considering a claim for asylum or humanitarian protection under this Part, 
she will consider any Article 8 elements of th at claim in line with the provisions of Appendix FM (family life) which 
are relevant to those elements and in line with paragraphs 276ADE to 276DH (private life) of these Rules.  
Definition of asylum applicant  
327. Under the Rules an asylum applicant is a p erson who either;  
(a) makes a request to be recognised as a refugee under the Geneva Convention on the basis that it would be 
contrary to the United Kingdom's obligations under the Geneva Convention for him to be removed from or 
required to leave the Unite d Kingdom, or   
(b) otherwise makes a request for international protection. ""Application for asylum"" shall be construed 
accordingly.   
327A. Every person has the right to make an application for asylum on his own behalf.  
Applications for asylum  
328. All asyl um applications will be determined by the Secretary of State in accordance with the Geneva 
Convention. Every asylum application made by a person at a port or airport in the United Kingdom will be referred 
by the Immigration Officer for determination by the  Secretary of State in accordance with these Rules.  
328A. The Secretary of State shall ensure that authorities which are likely to be addressed by someone who 
wishes to make an application for asylum are able to advise that person how and where such an app lication may 
be made.  
329. Until an asylum application has been determined by the Secretary of State or the Secretary of State has 
issued a certificate under Part 2, 3, 4 or 5 of Schedule 3 to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, 
etc.) Act 2 004 no action will be taken to require the departure of the asylum applicant or his dependants from the 
United Kingdom.  
330. If the Secretary of State decides to grant asylum and the person has not yet been given leave to enter, the 
Immigration Officer wil l grant limited leave to enter.  
331. If a person seeking leave to enter is refused asylum or their application for asylum is withdrawn or treated as 
withdrawn under paragraph 333C of these Rules, the Immigration Officer will consider whether or not he is i n a 
position to decide to give or refuse leave to enter without interviewing the person further. If the Immigration 
Officer decides that a further interview is not required he may serve the notice giving or refusing leave to enter by 
post. If the Immigrati on Officer decides that a further interview is required, he will then resume his examination to 
determine whether or not to grant the person leave to enter under any other provision of these Rules. If the 
person fails at any time to comply with a requireme nt to report to an Immigration Officer for examination, the 
Immigration Officer may direct that the person's examination shall be treated as concluded at that time. The 
ArchivedImmigration Officer will then consider any outstanding applications for entry on the ba sis of any evidence before 
him. 
332. If a person who has been refused leave to enter applies for asylum and that application is refused or 
withdrawn or treated as withdrawn under paragraph 333C of these Rules, leave to enter will again be refused 
unless th e applicant qualifies for admission under any other provision of these Rules.  
333. Written notice of decisions on applications for asylum shall be given in reasonable time. Where the applicant 
is legally represented, notice may instead be given to the repr esentative. Where the applicant has no legal 
representative and free legal assistance is not available, he shall be informed of the decision on the application 
for asylum and, if the application is rejected, how to challenge the decision, in a language tha t he may reasonably 
be supposed to understand.  
333A. The Secretary of State shall ensure that a decision is taken by him on each application for asylum as soon 
as possible, without prejudice to an adequate and complete examination.  
Where a decision on an a pplication for asylum cannot be taken within six months of the date it was recorded, the 
Secretary of State shall either:  
(a) inform the applicant of the delay; or   
(b) if the applicant has made a specific written request for it, provide information on the  timeframe within which 
the decision on his application is to be expected. The provision of such information shall not oblige the Secretary 
of State to take a decision within the stipulated time -frame.   
333B. Applicants for asylum shall be allowed an effec tive opportunity to consult, at their own expense or at public 
expense in accordance with provision made for this by the Legal Services Commission or otherwise, a person 
who is authorised under Part V of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to give immigrat ion advice. This

well-founded.  
Where an application for asylum was made on or after the 21st October 2004, the Secretary of State will revoke

(iv) he is not excluded from a grant of humanitarian protection.

339I. When the Secretary of State  considers a person's asylum claim, eligibility for a grant of humanitarian 
protection or human rights claim it is the duty of the person to submit to the Secretary of State as soon as 
possible all material factors needed to substantiate the asylum claim o r establish that he is a person eligible for 
Archivedhumanitarian protection or substantiate the human rights claim, which the Secretary of State shall assess in 
cooperation with the person.

(i) the person's statement on the reasons f or making an asylum claim or on eligibility for a grant of humanitarian 
protection or for making a human rights claim;   
(ii) all documentation at the person's disposal regarding the person's age, background (including background 
details of relevant relativ es), identity, nationality(ies), country(ies) and place(s) of previous residence, previous 
asylum applications, travel routes; and   
(iii) identity and travel documents.   
339IA. For the purposes of examining individual applications for asylum  
(i) informatio n provided in support of an application and the fact that an application has been made shall not be 
disclosed to the alleged actor(s) of persecution of the applicant, and   
(ii) information shall not be obtained from the alleged actor(s) of persecution that  would result in their being 
directly informed that an application for asylum has been made by the applicant in question and would jeopardise 
the physical integrity of the applicant and his dependants, or the liberty and security of his family members stil l 
living in the country of origin.   
This paragraph shall also apply where the Secretary of State is considering revoking a person's refugee status in 
accordance with these Rules.  
339J. The assessment by the Secretary of State of an asylum claim, eligibilit y for a grant of humanitarian 
protection or a human rights claim will be carried out on an individual, objective and impartial basis. This will 
include taking into account in particular:  
(i) all relevant facts as they relate to the country of origin or cou ntry of return at the time of taking a decision on 
the grant; including laws and regulations of the country of origin or country of return and the manner in which they 
are applied;   
(ii) relevant statements and documentation presented by the person includi ng information on whether the person 
has been or may be subject to persecution or serious harm;   
(iii) the individual position and personal circumstances of the person, including factors such as background, 
gender and age, so as to assess whether, on the b asis of the person's personal circumstances, the acts to which 
the person has been or could be exposed would amount to persecution or serious harm;   
(iv) whether the person's activities since leaving the country of origin or country of return were engaged in for the 
sole or main purpose of creating the necessary conditions for making an asylum claim or establishing that he is a 
person eligible for humanitarian protection or a human rights claim, so as to assess whether these activities will 
expose the perso n to persecution or serious harm if he returned to that country; and   
Archived(v) whether the person could reasonably be expected to avail himself of the protection of another country where 
he could assert citizenship.   
339JA. Reliable and up -to-date information s hall be obtained from various sources as to the general situation 
prevailing in the countries of origin of applicants for asylum and, where necessary, in countries through which 
they have transited. Such information shall be made available to the personnel  responsible for examining 
applications and taking decisions and may be provided to them in the form of a consolidated country information 
report.  
This paragraph shall also apply where the Secretary of State is considering revoking a person's refugee statu s in 
accordance with these Rules.  
339K. The fact that a person has already been subject to persecution or serious harm, or to direct threats of such 
persecution or such harm, will be regarded as a serious indication of the person's well -founded fear of 
persecution or real risk of suffering serious harm, unless there are good reasons to consider that such 
persecution or serious harm will not be repeated.  
339L. It is the duty of the person to substantiate the asylum claim or establish that he is a person elig ible 
humanitarian protection or substantiate his human rights claim. Where aspects of the person's statements are not 
supported by documentary or other evidence, those aspects will not need confirmation when all of the following

humanitarian protection or substantiate his human rights claim;   
(ii) all material factors at the person's disposal have been submitted, and a sati sfactory explanation regarding any 
lack of other relevant material has been given;   
(iii) the person's statements are found to be coherent and plausible and do not run counter to available specific 
and general information relevant to the person's case;   
(iv) the person has made an asylum claim or sought to establish that he is a person eligible for humanitarian 
protection or made a human rights claim at the earliest possible time, unless the person can demonstrate good 
reason for not having done so; and   
(v) the general credibility of the person has been established.   
339M. The Secretary of State may consider that a person has not substantiated his asylum claim or established 
that he is a person eligible for humanitarian protection or substantiated his human  rights claim, and thereby reject 
his application for asylum, determine that he is not eligible for humanitarian protection or reject his human rights 
claim, if he fails, without reasonable explanation, to make a prompt and full disclosure of material fact s, either 
orally or in writing, or otherwise to assist the Secretary of State in establishing the facts of the case; this includes, 
for example, failure to report to a designated place to be fingerprinted, failure to complete an asylum 
questionnaire or fai lure to comply with a requirement to report to an immigration officer for examination.  
Archived339MA. Applications for asylum shall be neither rejected nor excluded from examination on the sole ground that 
they have not been made as soon as possible.

will apply the provisions in s.8 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004.

339NA. Before a decision is taken o n the application for asylum, the applicant shall be given the opportunity of a

(i) the Secretary of State is able to take a positive decision on the basis of evidence available;   
(ii) the Secretary of State has already had a meeting with the applicant for the purpose of assisting him with 
completing his applicati on and submitting the essential information regarding the application;   
(iii) the applicant, in submitting his application and presenting the facts, has only raised issues that are not 
relevant or of minimal relevance to the examination of whether he is a refugee, as defined in regulation 2 of the 
Refugee or Person in Need of International Protection (Qualification) Regulations 2006;   
(iv) the applicant has made inconsistent, contradictory, improbable or insufficient representations which make his 
claim cle arly unconvincing in relation to his having been the object of persecution;   
(v) the applicant has submitted a subsequent application which does not raise any relevant new elements with 
respect to his particular circumstances or to the situation in his cou ntry of origin;   
(vi) the applicant is making an application merely in order to delay or frustrate the enforcement of an earlier or 
imminent decision which would result in his removal; and   
(vii) it is not reasonably practicable, in particular where the Se cretary of State is of the opinion that the applicant 
is unfit or unable to be interviewed owing to enduring circumstances beyond his control.   
The omission of a personal interview shall not prevent the Secretary of State from taking a decision on the 
application.  
Where the personal interview is omitted, the applicant and dependants shall be given a reasonable opportunity to 
submit further information. 
339NB. (i) The personal interview mentioned in paragraph 339NA above shall normally take place without the  
presence of the applicant's family members unless the Secretary of State considers it necessary for an

Rules.  
(ii) The Secre tary of State shall ensure that the applicant has timely access to the report of the personal interview 
and that access is possible as soon as necessary for allowing an appeal to be prepared and lodged in due time.  
339ND The Secretary of State shall provid e at public expense an interpreter for the purpose of allowing the 
applicant to submit his case, wherever necessary. The Secretary of State shall select an interpreter who can 
ensure appropriate communication between the applicant and the representative of  the Secretary of State who 
conducts the interview.  
Internal relocation  
339O (i) The Secretary of State will not make:  
(a) a grant of asylum if in part of the country of origin a person would not have a well founded fear of being 
persecuted, and the person  can reasonably be expected to stay in that part of the country;  
or  
(b) a grant of humanitarian protection if in part of the country of return a person would not face a real risk of 
suffering serious harm, and the person can reasonably be expected to stay  in that part of the country.   
(ii) In examining whether a part of the country of origin or country of return meets the requirements in (i) the 
Secretary of State, when making his decision on whether to grant asylum or humanitarian protection, will have 
regard to the general circumstances prevailing in that part of the country and to the personal circumstances of the 
person.  
(iii) (i) applies notwithstanding technical obstacles to return to the country of origin or country of return  
Sur place claims  
339P. A  person may have a well -founded fear of being persecuted or a real risk of suffering serious harm based

the Schedule to the Geneva Convention, for the purpose of travel outside the United Kingdom, unless compelling 
reasons of national security or public order otherwise require.

humanitarian protection.  
Third country cases  
345. (1) In a case where the Secretary of State is satisfied that the conditions set out in Paragraphs 4 and 5(1), 9 
and 10(1), 14 and 15(1) or 17 of Schedule 3 to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act

under Part 2, 3, 4 or 5 of Schedule 3 to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 as 
appropriate.  
(2) The Secretary of State shall not issue a certifica te under Part 2, 3, 4 or 5 of Schedule 3 to the Asylum and 
Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 unless:  
(i) the asylum applicant has not arrived in the United Kingdom directly from the country in which he claims to fear 
persecution and has h ad an opportunity at the border or within the third country or territory to make contact with 
the authorities of that third country or territory in order to seek their protection; or   
(ii) there is other clear evidence of his admissibility to a third count ry or territory.   
Provided that he is satisfied that a case meets these criteria, the Secretary of State is under no obligation to 
consult the authorities of the third country or territory before the removal of an asylum applicant to that country or 
territory. 
345(2A) Where a certificate is issued under Part 2, 3, 4 or 5 of Schedule 3 to the Asylum and Immigration 
(Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 the asylum applicant shall:  
(i) be informed in a language that he may reasonably be expected to understan d regarding his removal to a safe 
third country;   
(ii) be provided with a document informing the authorities of the safe third country, in the language of that country, 
that the asylum application has not been examined in substance by the authorities in th e United Kingdom;

of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 in relation to the asylum claim and the person is seeking leave to enter t he 
Immigration Officer will consider whether or not he is in a position to decide to give or refuse leave to enter 
without interviewing the person further. If the Immigration Officer decides that a further interview is not required 
he may serve the notice giving or refusing leave to enter by post. If the Immigration Officer decides that a further 
interview is required, he will then resume his examination to determine whether or not to grant the person leave 
to enter under any other provision of these Rules.  If the person fails at any time to comply with a requirement to 
report to an Immigration Officer for examination, the Immigration Officer may direct that the person's examination 
shall be treated as concluded at that time. The Immigration Officer will the n consider any outstanding applications

Dependants  
349. A spouse, civil partner, unmarried or same -sex partner, or minor child accompanying a principal applicant 
may be incl uded in his application for asylum as his dependant, provided, in the case of an adult dependant with 
legal capacity, the dependant consents to being treated as such at the time the application is lodged. A spouse, 
civil partner, unmarried or same -sex part ner or minor child may also claim asylum in his own right. If the principal 
applicant is granted asylum or humanitarian protection and leave to enter or remain any spouse, civil partner, 
unmarried or same -sex partner or minor child will be granted leave to  enter or remain for the same duration. The 
case of any dependant who claims asylum in his own right will be also considered individually in accordance with 
Archivedparagraph 334 above. An applicant under this paragraph, including an accompanied child, may be inte rviewed 
where he makes a claim as a dependant or in his own right.  
If the spouse, civil partner, unmarried or same -sex partner, or minor child in question has a claim in his own right, 
that claim should be made at the earliest opportunity. Any failure to d o so will be taken into account and may 
damage credibility if no reasonable explanation for it is given. Where an asylum or humanitarian protection 
application is unsuccessful, at the same time that asylum or humanitarian protection is refused the applican t may 
be notified of removal directions or served with a notice of the Secretary of State's intention to deport him, as 
appropriate. In this paragraph and paragraphs 350 -352 a child means a person who is under 18 years of age or 
who, in the absence of docu mentary evidence establishing age, appears to be under that age. An unmarried or 
same sex partner for the purposes of this paragraph, is a person who has been living together with the principal 
applicant in a subsisting relationship akin to marriage or a c ivil partnership for two years or more.  
Unaccompanied children 
350. Unaccompanied children may also apply for asylum and, in view of their potential vulnerability, particular 
priority and care is to be given to the handling of their cases.  
351. A person of  any age may qualify for refugee status under the Convention and the criteria in paragraph 334 
apply to all cases. However, account should be taken of the applicant's maturity and in assessing the claim of a 
child more weight should be given to objective i ndications of risk than to the child's state of mind and 
understanding of his situation. An asylum application made on behalf of a child should not be refused solely 
because the child is too young to understand his situation or to have formed a well founde d fear of persecution. 
Close attention should be given to the welfare of the child at all times.

A362. Where Article 8 is raised in the context of deportation under Part 13 of these Ru les, the claim under Article 
8 will only succeed where the requirements of these rules as at 9 July 2012 are met, regardless of when the 
notice of intention to deport or the deportation order, as appropriate, was served.  
362. A deportation order requires t he subject to leave the United Kingdom and authorises his detention until he is 
removed. It also prohibits him from re -entering the country for as long as it is in force and invalidates any leave to 
enter or remain in the United Kingdom given him before th e Order is made or while it is in force.  
Archived363. The circumstances in which a person is liable to deportation include:  
(i) where the Secretary of State deems the person's deportation to be conducive to the public good;   
(ii) where the person is the spouse or civil partner or child under 18 of a person ordered to be deported; and   
(iii) where a court recommends deportation in the case of a person over the age of 17 who has been convicted of 
an offence punishable with imprisonment.   
363A. Prior to 2 October 2000 , a person would have been liable to deportation in certain circumstances in which 
he is now liable to administrative removal. However, such a person remains liable to deportation, rather than 
administrative removal where:  
(i) a decision to make a deportat ion order against him was taken before 2 October 2000; or   
(ii) the person has made a valid application under the Immigration (Regularisation Period for Overstayers) 
Regulations 2000.   
Deportation of family members  
364. DELETED  
364A. DELETED  
365. Section 5 of the Immigration Act 1971 gives the Secretary of State power in certain circumstances to make a 
deportation order against the spouse, civil partner or child of a person against whom a deportation order has 
been made. The Secretary of State will not norm ally decide to deport the spouse or civil partner of a deportee 
where:  
(i) he has qualified for settlement in his own right; or   
(ii) he has been living apart from the deportee.   
366. The Secretary of State will not normally decide to deport the child of a  deportee where:  
(i) he and his mother or father are living apart from the deportee; or   
(ii) he has left home and established himself on an independent basis; or   
(iii) he married or formed a civil partnership before deportation came into prospect.   
367.D ELETED  
368. Where the Secretary of State decides that it would be appropriate to deport a member of a family as such, 
the decision, and the right of appeal, will be notified and it will at the same time be explained that it is open to the 
member of the fam ily to leave the country voluntarily if he does not wish to appeal or if he appeals and his appeal 
is dismissed.

378. A deportation order may not be made while it is still open to the person to appeal against the Secretary of 
State's decision, or while an appeal is pending except where the Secretary of State is required to make the 
deportation or der in respect of a foreign criminal under section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007. There is no 
appeal within the immigration appeal system against the making of a deportation order on the recommendation of 
a court; but there is a right of appeal to a hig her court against the recommendation itself. A deportation order may 
not be made while it is still open to the person to appeal against the relevant conviction, sentence or 
recommendation, or while such an appeal is pending.

Procedure  
381. When a decision to make a deportation order has been taken (otherwise than on the recommendation of a 
court) a notice will be given to the person concerned informing him of the decision and of his rig ht of appeal.  
Archived382. Following the issue of such a notice the Secretary of State may authorise detention or make an order 
restricting a person as to residence, employment or occupation and requiring him to report to the police, pending 
the making of a deport ation order.  
383. DELETED  
384. If a notice of appeal is given within the period allowed, a summary of the facts of the case on the basis of 
which the decision was taken will be sent to the appropriate appellate authorities, who will notify the appellant of  
the arrangements for the appeal to be heard.  
Arrangements for removal  
385. A person against whom a deportation order has been made will normally be removed from the United 
Kingdom. The power is to be exercised so as to secure the person's return to the co untry of which he is a 
national, or which has most recently provided him with a travel document, unless he can show that another 
country will receive him. In considering any departure from the normal arrangements, regard will be had to the 
public interest generally, and to any additional expense that may fall on public funds.  
386. The person will not be removed as the subject of a deportation order while an appeal may be brought 
against the removal directions or such an appeal is pending.  
Supervised departu re 
387. DELETED  
Returned deportees  
388. Where a person returns to this country when a deportation order is in force against him, he may be deported 
under the original order. The Secretary of State will consider every such case in the light of all the relev ant 
circumstances before deciding whether to enforce the order.  
Returned family members  
389. Persons deported in the circumstances set out in paragraphs 365 -368 above (deportation of family 
members) may be able to seek re -admission to the United Kingdom un der the Immigration Rules where:  
(i) a child reaches 18 (when he ceases to be subject to the deportation order); or   
(ii) in the case of a spouse or civil partner, the marriage or civil partnership comes to an end.   
Revocation of deportation order  
390. An application for revocation of a deportation order will be considered in the light of all the circumstances 
including the following:  
(i) the grounds on which the order was made;   
Archived(ii) any representations made in support of revocation;   
(iii) the interests o f the community, including the maintenance of an effective immigration control;   
(iv) the interests of the applicant, including any compassionate circumstances.   
390A. Where paragraph 398 applies the Secretary of State will consider whether paragraph 399 o r 399A applies 
and, if it does not, it will only be in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in maintaining the 
deportation order will be outweighed by other factors.  
391. In the case of a person who has been deported following conviction for a criminal offence, the continuation 
of a deportation order against that person will be the proper course:  
(a) in the case of a conviction for an offence for which the person was sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 
less than 4 years, unless 10 years h ave elapsed since the making of the deportation order, or   
(b) in the case of a conviction for an offence for which the person was sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 
at least 4 years, at any time,   
Unless, in either case, the continuation would be co ntrary to the Human Rights Convention or the Convention 
and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, or there are other exceptional circumstances that mean the 
continuation is outweighed by compelling factors.  
391A. In other cases, revocation of the or der will not normally be authorised unless the situation has been 
materially altered, either by a change of circumstances since the order was made, or by fresh information coming 
to light which was not before the appellate authorities or the Secretary of S tate. The passage of time since the 
person was deported may also in itself amount to such a change of circumstances as to warrant revocation of the 
order.  
392. Revocation of a deportation order does not entitle the person concerned to re -enter the United K ingdom; it 
renders him eligible to apply for admission under the Immigration Rules. Application for revocation of the order 
may be made to the Entry Clearance Officer or direct to the Home Office.  
Rights of appeal in relation to a decision not to revoke a deportation order  
393. DELETED  
394. DELETED  
395. There may be a right of appeal against refusal to revoke a deportation order. Where an appeal does lie the 
right of appeal will be notified at the same time as the decision to refuse to revoke the order.  
396. Where a person is liable to deportation the presumption shall be that the public interest requires deportation. 
It is in the public interest to deport where the Secretary of State must make a deportation order in accordance 
with section 32 of the UK Bord ers Act 2007.  
Archived397. A deportation order will not be made if the person's removal pursuant to the order would be contrary to the 
UK's obligations under the Refugee Convention or the Human Rights Convention. Where deportation would not 
be contrary to these ob ligations, it will only be in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in deportation 
is outweighed.  
Deportation and Article 8  
398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the 
Huma n Rights Convention, and  
(a) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to the public good because they have been convicted 
of an offence for which they have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;  
(b) the deportation of  the person from the UK is conducive to the public good because they have been convicted 
of an offence for which they have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12  
months; or  
(c) the deportation of the person from the  UK is conducive to the public good because, in the view of the 
Secretary of State, their offending has caused serious harm or they are a persistent offender who shows a 
particular disregard for the law,  
the Secretary of State in assessing that claim will consider whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does 
not, it will only be in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in deportation will be outweighed by other 
factors.  
399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c) applies  if – 
(a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a child under the age of 18 years who is in 
the UK, and  
(i) the child is a British Citizen; or  
(ii) the child has lived in the UK continuously for at least the 7 years immediately  preceding the date of the 
immigration decision; and in either case  
(a) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK; and  
(b) there is no other family member who is able to care for the child in the UK; or   
 
(b) the person has a genuine a nd subsisting relationship with a partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, 
settled in the UK, or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection, and  
(i) the person has lived in the UK with valid leave continuously for at least the 15 yea rs immediately preceding the 
date of the immigration decision (discounting any period of imprisonment); and  
(ii) there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner continuing outside the UK.   
 
399A. This paragraph applies where paragraph 3 98(b) or (c) applies if – 
Archived(a) the person has lived continuously in the UK for at least 20 years immediately preceding the date of the 
immigration decision (discounting any period of imprisonment) and he has no ties (including social, cultural or 
family) wi th the country to which he would have to go if required to leave the UK; or  
(b) the person is aged under 25 years, he has spent at least half of his life living continuously in the UK 
immediately preceding the date of the immigration decision (discounting any period of imprisonment) and he has 
no ties (including social, cultural or family) with the country to which he would have to go if required to leave the 
UK. 
399B. Where paragraph 399 or 399A applies limited leave may be granted for periods not exceedin g 30 months. 
Such leave shall be given subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State deems appropriate. Where a 
person who has previously been granted a period of leave under paragraph 399B would not fall for refusal under 
paragraph 322(1C), indefin ite leave to remain may be granted.  
399C. DELETED  
400. Where a person claims that their removal under paragraphs 8 to 10 of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 
1971, section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 or section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum a nd 
Nationality Act 2006 would be contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention, 
the Secretary of State may require an application under paragraph 276ADE (private life) or Appendix FM (family 
life) of these rules. Where an application is not required, in assessing that claim the Secretary of State or an 
immigration officer will, subject to paragraph 353, consider that claim against the requirements to be met under 
paragraph 276ADE or Appendix FM and if appropriate the remova l decision will be cancelled.

           as  if it had been received in the following month if the Secretary   
           of  State considers that the information stated in the application  
           requires verification checks, and may be refused if the information  
           cannot be verified or is  confirmed as false.  
(ii) If the verification checks are prolonged due to the failure of the Sponsor to co -operate with the verification 
process such that the application cannot be considered as if it had been received in the next month, the 
application wi ll be refused.  
82D. These provisional monthly allocations may be adjusted according to the processes set out in paragraphs 83

the undersubscribed current month.  
83B. Subject to paragraph 83e below, if the number of applications is greater than the monthly allocation:  
(a) The minimum points level at which applications for Certificates of Sponsorship will be granted will be 
calculated as follows:  
(i) if the number of applications scoring 32 points or more is no more  than 100 greater than the monthly 
allocation, all applications which score 32 points or more will be granted.  
(ii) if the number of applications scoring 32 points or more is more than 100 greater than the monthly allocation, X 
(being both the number of po ints scored in Table 11D above and the minimum number of points   required for an 
application to be granted) will be increased by 1 point incrementally until the number of applications scoring X 
points is:  
(1) less than or equal to the monthly allocation; or 
(2) no more than 100 greater than the monthly allocation;  
whichever results in the higher value of X, at which stage all applications which score X points or more will be 
granted.  
(b) if the number of applications granted under (a) above is less than th e monthly allocation, the number 
remaining under the monthly allocation will be added to the next monthly allocation.  
Archived(c) if the number of applications granted under (a) above is more than the monthly allocation, the number by 
which the monthly allocation is exceeded will be subtracted from the next monthly allocation.  
83C. If a Sponsor is allocated one or more Certificates of Sponsorship under the Tier 2 (General) limit which it 
then elects not to assign to a migrant it may return them to the Secretary of State and the Secretary of State will

made to the next monthly allocation, and  
(ii) References to 'more than 100 greater than the monthly allocation' in paragraphs 83B(a)(ii) to (iii) are amended 
to 'greater than the monthly allocation', such that the total Tier 2 (General) limit in the period 6 April to 5 April

Appendix J: Codes of Practice for Tier 2 Sponsors, Tier 5 
Sponsors and employers of Work Permit Holders  
Introduction  
1. This Appendix sets out the skill level and appropriate salary rate for jobs, as referred to else where in these 
Rules.  
2. The Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes are based on the SOC 2010 system designed by the 
Office for National Statistics, except where otherwise stated. This system is designed to cover all possible jobs. 
The related jo b titles listed in Tables 1 to 7 of this Appendix are taken from guidance published by the Office for 
National Statistics.  
3. References to ""job"" refer to the most appropriate match for the job in question, as it appears in the tables in 
this Appendix. The  job description must correlate with the most appropriate match, according to further guidance 
on the SOC 2010 system published by the Office for National Statistics, and reproduced in codes of practice for 
Sponsors published by the UK Border Agency. The m ost appropriate match may be applied based on the job 
description in an application, even if this is not the match stated by the applicant or his Sponsor.  
4. Table 8 of this Appendix also sets out advertising and evidential requirements for creative sector  jobs, as 
referred to elsewhere in these Rules.  
Archived 
Tables  
5. Table 1 sets out PhD -level occupation codes.  
6. Table 2 sets out occupations skilled to National Qualifications Framework level 6 or above.  
7. Table 3 sets out occupations skilled to National Quali fications Framework level 4 or above.  
8. Table 4 sets out occupations skilled to National Qualifications Framework level 3 or above.  
9. Table 5 sets out occupations in which some jobs are skilled to National Qualifications Framework level 3 and 
some jobs a re lower -skilled  
10. Table 6 sets out occupations skilled below National Qualifications Framework level 3.  
11. Table 7 sets out occupations which are ineligible for Sponsorship in Tier 2 (General) and Tier 2 (Intra -
Company Transfer) applications, for reaso ns other than skill level.  
12. (a) Table 8 sets out the equivalent SOC 2010 codes in comparison to the SOC 2000 system, for all 
occupations that appear in Tables 1 to 5. This table is provided for applicants and Sponsors who relied on a SOC 
2000 code in a previous application, and need to know the equivalent SOC 2010 code if the applicant is applying 
to continue working in the same occupation.  
(b) Where Appendix A of these Rules refers to an applicant continuing to work in the same occupation, this 
means:  
(i) the same SOC 2010 code as stated in the Certificate of Sponsorship Checking Service entry that led to the 
applicant's previous grant, or  
(ii) a SOC 2010 code which Table 8 shows as being equivalent to the SOC 2000 code stated in the Certificate of 
Spons orship Checking Service entry that led to the applicant's previous grant.   
13. Table 9 sets out creative sector codes of practice.  
 
Appropriate salary rates  
14. Where these Rules state that an applicant must be paid the appropriate rate for a job as set ou t in this 
Appendix, the rate will be determined as follows:  
(a) Where the most appropriate match for the job in question appears in Tables 1 to 5 or Table 9, the appropriate 
rate is as stated in the relevant Table.  
(b) Where the most appropriate match for the job in question appears in one of Tables 1 to 5 and also appears in 
Table 9, the appropriate rate is as stated in Table 9, and the rates stated in Tables 1 to 5 do not apply.  
(c) Table 8 is to be used for identifying the equivalent SOC 2010 code only. The appropriate rate must then be 
identified for that SOC 2010 code using the other tables, where relevant.  
(d) Where both ""new entrant"" and ""experienced worker"" rates are stated in Tables 1 to 5, the ""new entrant"" rate 
will only apply if the applicant:  
Archived(i) is applying as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant and scores points from the Post -Study Work provisions of Appendix 
A,  
(ii) is applying as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant and scores points from the Resident Labour Market Test provisions 
of Appendix A, on the basis t hat his Sponsor has carried out a university milkround,   
(iii) is applying as a Tier 2 (Intra -Company Transfer) Migrant in the Graduate Trainee sub -category, or   
(iv) was under the age of 26 on the date the application was made,   
and is not applying for a grant of leave that would extend his total stay in Tier 2 and/or as a Work Permit Holder 
beyond 3 years and 1 month.  
The ""experienced worker"" rate will apply in all other cases.  
(e) The rates stated are per year and are based on a 39 -hour week. Where the a pplicant has contracted weekly 
hours or is paid an hourly rate, the rates must be pro -rated accordingly.  
(f) In all cases, the pay must be compliant with National Minimum Wage regulations.

working days prior to the issuing of the certificate with details of the filming schedules. This is in order 
to verify that the migrant is being genuinely enga ged for reasons of continuity. Sponsors may issue 
Certificates of Sponsorship for performers to enter the UK to undertake post -production work only 
and provided that such post -production work solely relates to their own role in the film or TV 
production. F or such Certificate of Sponsorship, neither the one month requirement nor prior notice 
to Equity procedure applies. The Sponsor must be able to supply documentary proof that the

Sponsors should first attempt to conduct searches in the EEA as set out in category 3 to a 
reasonable degree. Ho wever, it is recognised that the extent of such searches within the EEA shall 
be proportionate to the rarity and specialty of the attributes of the role. The Sponsor must be able to 
provide proof:  
 that the role requires certain highly specialist attributes ; and  
 that the performer possesses those attributes; and  
 of the casting process and casting considerations; and  
 of reasonable and appropriate searches in the EEA (if applicable); and  
 a list of any EEA candidates who were unavailable at the required time.

formal letter in support from a principal financier, or distributor. The Sp onsor must give prior notice to 
Equity providing supporting evidence detailing: description of the role and film, and the reasons why 
advertising was not appropriate and a letter in support. The sponsor must provide Equity with:  
 the details of the performe r(s) required, role, description of the production; and  
 the reasons why the role has not been advertised; and,  
 a formal letter in support of the migrant from a financier or distributor; and  
 if the performer is an up -and-coming performer, or cast to appeal to a particular overseas 
audience, then evidence of their CV, reviews, previous work, awards/accolades, and/or evidence of 
audience appeal would be required.

appropriate journal, newspap er, website or online directory. The choice of advertising medium should 
be appropriate for the particular role. The following advertising media may be appropriate: searching 
relevant online directories such as the Knowledge Online, Production Base, or thr ough industry 
organisations such as the Production Guild. Other forms of advertising may be appropriate depending 
on the type of role. For longer terms contracts advertisements in Guardian Media, Broadcast, Screen 
International, Marketing Week would be app ropriate.   
 
Under this category, in the case of camera, editing and grip grades, and 1st Assistant Directors, the

The Sponsor must notify BECTU promptly of the issuing of a certificate under this category for a  PA 
to a Director and must notify the Production Guild promptly of the issuing of a certificate for a PA to a 
Producer. They may request sight of the evidence in support for such roles. Sponsors issuing 
certificates to migrants under this category must be able to supply proof that:  
 the migrant has a significant previous working relationship with the Director or Producer (a 
""significant"" previous working relationship entails an established pattern of joint working on a number 
of previous productions rather t han isolated or random examples); and

 Introduction  
 
This page introduces you to the single power of immigration bail.  
 
It is published policy that whilst detention is used to maintain effective immigration 
control, t here is a presumption in favour of liberty  and, wherever possible, 
alternatives to detention must be used.  
 
Schedule 10  replaced the various pre -existing alternatives to detention (temporary 
admission, temporary release on bail and release on restrictions) by a single power 
to grant immigration bail.  
 
This guidance applies to the use of immigration bail in cases managed by Border 
Force, UK Visas and Immigration, and Immigration Enforcement. It replaces all 
previous guidance on:  
 
• temporary admission  
• temporary release on bail  
• release on restrictions  
 
 The purpose  of immigration bail is  to facilitate those  who have no legal basis to 
remain in the UK and are liable  to be, or have been,  detained  for the purposes of 
removal .. See: Eligibility for immigration bail . 
 
Further information about immigration detention  can be found  on GOV.UK  in the 
Detention: General Instructions . 
 
Transitional provisions  
 
Commencement of Schedule 10 in 2016 introduced a single bail power  whereby  
those subject to  one of the previous alternatives to detention will retrospectively be 
considered  as having been granted immigration bail, and subject to the same 
conditions  unless they need to be reviewed.  
 
Further information can be found under Transitional arrangements .

 Eligibility for immigration bail  
 
This page tells you about those who are eligible for immigration bail.  
 
Any person detained, or liable to be detained, under any of the following provisions is 
eligible to be granted immigration bail by the Secretary of State:  
 
• paragraph 16(1), (1A) or (2) of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 
(detention by immigration officers of persons liable to examination or removal)  
• paragraph 2(1), (2) or (3) of Schedule 3 to that Act (detention pending 
deportation)  
• section 62 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (detention by 
Secretary of State of persons liable to examination or removal)  
• section 36(1) of the UK Borders Act 2007 (detention pending automatic 
deportation)  
 
A person who is liable to be detained under any of the above provisions can be 
granted, and remain on, immigration bail even if they can no longer be lawfully 
detained , for example , where there is no realistic prospect of the ir  removal taking 
place within a reasonable time.  
 
The above extends to those against whom the Secretary of State is considering 
making a deportation order under section 5(1) of the Immigration Act 1971 and are 
no longer liable to be detained.

 Power to grant immigration bail  
 
This page tells you about the legal powers to grant immigration bail. It also tells you 
when a grant of immigration bail begins and when it ends.  
 
See also: Level of authority to grant or refuse immigration bail . 
 
The statutory power to grant immigration bail is in paragraph 1 of Schedule 10 .  
 
The power to grant immigration bail is available to the Secretary of State (in practice, 
a person acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, including an immigration officer) 
if a person is:  
 
• detained under any of the detention powers listed in the bullet points in 
Eligibility for immigration bail  
• liable to be detained under any of the detention powers listed in the bullet 
points in Eligibility for immigration bail   
 
The Secretary of State may consider granting immigration bail if officials appointed 
on their behalf   think it is appropriate for the person on a case -by-case basis , even if 
they have not  submitted an application  for bail. If a detained person wishes to apply 
to the Secretary of State for a grant of immigration bail, the person must do so using 
the  BAIL 401  application form  (which can be found on Atlas ). In most cases, bail will 
be granted using the BAIL 201 – notification of grant  / variation of immigrat ion bail 
form (which can be found on Atlas ). However, some casework refusal notices also 
contain the option for granting immigration bail.  
 
The power to grant immigration bail is available to the First -tier Tribunal if a person is 
already detained under any of the powers in paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 10 ( for 
further information see: Eligibility for immigration bail ). The Tribunal has no power to 
grant immigration bail to a person who is liable to detention but not detained. For 
further information, s ee Statutory limitations on First -tier Tribunal power to grant 
immigration bail . 
 
A detained person who wishes to be granted bail by the Tribunal must submit an 
application in writing to the Tribunal using Form B1 .  
 
The fact that a person has been granted immigration bail does not prevent the 
person’s possible arrest and subsequent detention under one of the provisions 
mentioned in Eligibility for immigration bail . This allows a person on immigration bail 
to be detained pending an enforced removal, for example , where the person has 
been granted bail whilst waiting for a travel document which then becomes available.  
 
Duration of immigration bail  
 
The duration of  immigration bail lasts from the point a person is granted to when it 
ends. These events are defined in paragraphs 1 and 3 of Schedule 10 . 
 Page 12 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 A grant of immigration bail starts from the time that is stated on the notice granting it. 
The notice may state that bail is conditional on certain arrangements being in place, 
and that it starts once those arrangements have been made.  
 
A grant of immigration bail ends when the person to whom it is granted is:  
 
• no longer liable to be detained and the Secretary of State is not considering 
whether to make a deportation order against the person  
• granted leave to enter or remain in the UK  
• detained under one of the provisions mentioned in Eligibility for immigration 
bail 
• removed from, or otherwise leaves, the UK

 Conditions of immigration bail  
 
This page tells you about the conditions that must be attached to a grant of 
immigration bail.  
 
Immigration bail conditions: general  
 
See also:  
 
• Persons detained pending deportation action  
• Varying immigration bail conditions  
 
The grant of immigration bail to a person must be subject to at least one of the 
following:  
 
• a condition requiring the person to appear before the Secretary of State or the 
First-tier Tribunal  at a specified time and place  
• a condition restricting the person’s work, occupation or studies  in the UK  
• a condition about the person’s residence  
• a condition requiring the person to report to the Secretary of State or other 
person specified  
• an electronic monitoring  condition  
• such other condition  as the person granting the immigration bail sees fit (for 
example: curfew; requirement to notify the Home Office of change in 
circumstances)  
 
Decision makers may also impose a financial condition , but this must be in addition 
to, and attached to , one or more of the above conditions.  
 
When setting a condition of immigration bail, the Secretary of State must be satisfied 
that the individual will be able to comply with that condition from the start of a grant 
of immigration bail.  
 
The number and type of immigration bail conditions to impose will vary depending on 
the circumstances of the individual case. For example, a person being granted 
immigration bail from detention while barriers to removal are resolved may require 
more string ent bail conditions than a person being granted immigration bail from a 
position of liberty (for example, on arrival at a port of entry or on submission of an in -
country application) while an outstanding application is considered. This is because, 
at their  respective stages of the process, the latter would generally have more of an 
incentive to cooperate with the authorities than the former.  In reaching a decision on 
appropriate bail conditions, decision makers must have regard to the matters listed 
under Exercising the power to grant immigration bail . 
 
The conditions imposed must:  
 
• consider  the facts of the individual case  Page 14 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 • enable the Home Office to maintain appropriate levels of contact with the 
individual  
• reduce the risk of non -compliance, including absconding  
• minimise potential delay in the Home Office becoming aware of any non -
compliance  
• be in furtherance of facilitating the individual’s return  
 
Where a  person  has been issued with a Certificate of Application (COA) following a 
valid EU Settlement Scheme application, any bail conditions already imposed should 
be reviewed to ensure they do not interfere with their temporary protection rights 
under the EU withdraw al agreement, such as a right to work. For more information 
see EU Settlement Scheme: EU, other EEA and Swiss citizens and their family 
members . 
 
Where a person does not have a firm address to reside at whilst on bail, it may be 
necessary to apply an ‘other’ condition of bail, requiring the person to notify the 
Home Office of alternative contact details and any changes to the details that have 
been provided, or details of an address where a person finds their own 
accommodation whilst on bail.  
 
Decision makers should be aware that breach of bail conditions gives rise to the 
possibility of criminal proceedings and a fine or imprisonment ( for further information, 
see Non-compliance with immigration bail: criminal penalties ). Decision makers must 
therefore keep this in mind when setting conditions, particularly ‘other ’ conditions 
(the gravity of the breach should be such that prosecution could be a proportionate 
outcome).  
 
Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 requires certain 
Home Office functions to be carried out having regard to the need to safeguard and 
promote the welfare of children in the UK. Decision makers must therefore ensure 
they have r egard to this need when making decisions on immigration bail which may 
involve or impact on children under the age of 18. All available information and 
evidence must be carefully considered to determine if the grant of bail or the 
imposition of the propose d bail conditions would be contrary to a child’s best 
interests. Where this is the case, decision makers must consider and record on file 
whether those interests are outweighed by the reasons in favour of granting bail and 
of imposing the bail conditions p roposed in the individual circumstances.  
 
Immigration bail conditions: appearance before Secretary 
of State or Tribunal  
 
This is for a one -off event and not for a regular reporting condition, which is separate 
(for further information, see Immigration bail conditions: reporting ). 
 
Examples of when a grant of immigration bail subject to a condition requiring 
appearance before the Secretary of State at a required time and place may be used 
include for:  
 Page 15 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 • self check -in returns, to allow collection of passports, tickets or other 
documents from the airport and for departure  
• attending travel documentation or other application -related interviews at the 
Home Office or a place of immigration detention  
• attending for return flights following refusal of leave to enter at a port of entry  
 
Decision makers must not use this condition to require a person to attend an 
Embassy, High Commission or Consulate for re -documentation for removal 
purposes, or any other voluntary action.  
 
A condition requiring appearance before the Tribunal at a required time and place 
would usually be necessary where a person has on -going proceedings before the 
Tribunal. A condition of this kind will generally be appropriate where the Tribunal 
grants bail rather than the Secretary of State.  
 
Self check -in 
 
Where this condition is used for a self check -in return:  
 
• the Notification of grant/variation of immigration bail notice (BAIL 201) must be 
given to the individual  
• the self check -in notice (BAIL 20 2(SCI)) must be given to the appropriate 
carrier when requested  
 
Immigration bail conditions: restrictions on work, 
occupation or studies  
 
Work or occupation  
 
If the person being granted immigration bail does not have any leave to enter or 
remain in the UK, it will be appropriate to impose a bail condition restricting work in 
the majority of cases.  
 
It may be appropriate to impose an immigration bail condition that restricts a 
person’s work  or occupation if that person had leave permitting these activities,  but 
that leave has been curtailed. It may also , depending on the facts of the individual 
case,  be appropriate for European Economic Area citizens who are granted 
immigration bail pending deportation action.  
 
An asylum seeker, or a failed asylum seeker with outstanding protection -based 
further submissions,  whose claim has been outstanding for more than 12 months 
through no fault of their own, may be granted permission to work . Those who are 
allowed to work are restricted to jobs on the Shortage Occupation List .  
 
Study  
 
In this context, ‘study ’ is taken to mean primary and secondary school for children 
and young adults up to and including the age of 18, and courses which may lead to a Page 16 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 qualification for adults, including English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) 
courses.  However, children up  until the age of 18 are entitled to education, and so 
should be set a condition permitting study.  
 
A person does not have to be given a study condition permitting or prohibiting 
study. They must have at least one other condition of bail. If there is any doubt 
over whether study should be restricted, no study condition should be applied. 
Either leave the box on the BAIL 201 notice (or relevant refusal notice) blank or  
delete the study condition.  
 
Bail conditions prohibiting study must be authorised at a minimum grade of 
HEO  / CIO equivalent grades. Consideration must be given to whether the 
individual is already studying or wish es to commence a course , the length of 
course or whether the individual is undertaking significant exams, for example 
A levels or their equivalents or university finals, and what the timescale is 
when taking removal action into account, and therefore the impact of a study 
restriction.  
 
Children  
 
Children can  access education services until the age of 18, and they must be 
permitted to study  up to and including the final year of school in which they turn 18 . 
You should not set a study condition that they must attend school. However,  you 
can, where dealing with a family group, specify that a child may only attend a named 
school (the one they already attend or will be attending) to ensure a family stays 
within a particular location.  
 
Where Border Force officers refuse entry to children at the border who are coming to 
the UK to study at state schools but who do not have the correct  Entry Clearance 
(EC), then if they are being  granted immigration bail , no study condition should be 
applied to them.  This is because all  children under the age of 18 are entitled to free 
education, even where they are liable for removal from the UK . 
 
Asylum seekers  
 
There is nothing in the Immigration Rules to prevent asylum seekers studying . 
Therefore, anyone who claims asylum should not have a study condition applied to 
them.  
 
A condition prohibiting study may be applied at the point an asylum seeker becomes 
appeal rights exhausted , if considered necessary on the facts of the individual case . 
The decision maker must  have  due regard to the matters under  Exercising the power 
to grant immigration bail . This includes those asylum seekers who are also 
immigration offenders ( for example,  illegal entrants via clandestine entry), but see 
below for steps to take to check if they are former unaccompanied asylum -seeking 
children (UASC) or unaccompanied children.  
 
If an asylum seeker who has exhausted their  appeal rights submits further 
representations and these are accepted as a fresh claim, the decision maker must lift 
any study restriction applied to the person. If an asylum seeker who has exhausted Page 17 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 their appeal rights submits  further representations and a decision on whether the se 
constitute a fresh claim remains pending beyond the usual period  of time for making 
such a decision , the decision maker must consider lifting any study restriction 
applied to the person.  
 
Former UASC care leavers who have turned 18 and who have an application or 
appeal pending or with ongoing litigation in respect of a decision in relation to their 
asylum claim, must be permitted to study. They should continue to be permitted to 
study until  they become appeal rights exhausted (ARE). This includes those who did 
not receive an adverse decision on their application until after turning 1 7 and a half  
and so were not granted temporary UASC leave, but still have a right of appeal.  
 
In all cases where someone becomes ARE and consideration is being given to 
prohibiting study, decision makers must take the following steps:  
 
1. Check whether the individual arrived in the UK as a UASC/unaccompanied 
child (and therefore may still be in receipt of ‘leaving care ’ support, including 
education, from the local authority (LA)). You  should  check  Atlas to determine 
this.  
2. If they have arrived in the UK as a UASC, then confirm with the individual 
whether they are still in receipt of ‘leaving care ’ support, including support in 
education. If so, then do not apply any study condition. If there is doubt about 
whether the LA is still providing ‘leaving care ’ support, then you should 
exercise caution and should not apply  a study condition to them at that time 
pending further enquires with the LA.  
3. If they have not  arrived as a UASC/unaccompanied child then they will not be 
in receipt of ‘leaving care’ support and a ‘no study ’ condition may be applied 
when they become ARE.  
4. Consider the impact of a study restriction on the facts of the individual case.  
 
Admissions to higher education (HE) institutions are a matter for the institutions 
concerned with policies varying between institutions.  
 
Under section 71 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 , decision 
makers can apply a study condition to individuals who claim asylum when they have 
valid leave to enter or remain in another category. This should be in line with the 
person’s leave, so a Tier 4 student must be permitted to study. These individuals 
may be restricted to studying at a particular institution. For further information s ee 
Asylum claims from persons with leave . 
 
Immigration offenders  
 
Non-asylum seeking adult immigration offenders who are liable to removal should 
normally be prohibited from studying.  
 
Deportation cases  
 
Where a person is granted bail pending deportation (this includes pending the 
making of a deportation order (DO) as well as in pursuit of a DO), if they are under 
18 or turning 18 in their final school year, they must not be prohibited from studying.  Page 18 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
  
If they are over 18, they should normally be prohibited from studying, unless they are 
an asylum seeker with an application or appeal pending and the DO is not signed 
and in  force. However, if a licence condition requires attendance on a course, they 
must  be given permission to study, but limited to ‘as specified in your licence 
conditions ’. Any decision to prohibit a person from studying who is subject to a 
deportation order must be made on the basis of the particular facts of the case.  
 
The study condition can also be used in national  security cases where a restriction 
on studying may be imposed as part of a package to manage those with whom an 
individual is able to associate.

Immigration bail conditions: residence  
 
It will not usually be necessary to impose a residence condition. A residence 
condition should only usually be imposed where residence at a particular address is 
necessary to enable a high level of contact or mitigate against a serious risk of non -
complian ce. This is more likely where the person poses a high risk of harm to the 
public on the basis of criminality or in cases concerning national security.  
 
This does not mean that people granted immigration bail do not need to provide a 
contact address and they can, for example, be subject to a condition which requires 
them to keep the Home Office informed of their contact details, including their current 
place of residence. If a person who is detained is not able to provide a bail address , 
decision makers may only use this as  grounds for opposing bail if they consider a 
condition requiring the person to live at a particular address  to be necessary  and the 
individual does not qualify for  Home Office support . 
 
Asylum seekers and failed asylum seekers accommodated by the Home Office 
under section 95, 98 and 4(2) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999  do not need Page 20 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 to be subject to a residence condition unless there are specific reasons why they 
must live at a particular address. Where this is the case, decision makers may 
impose a residence condition specifying that they live at ‘an address which will be 
separately notified to you by your accommodation provider ’. 
 
Decision makers must not apply a residence condition to a grant of immigration bail 
if both the following apply : 
 
• the individual is disqualified from renting – individuals who require leave to 
enter or remain but do not have it are disqualified from renting unless  they 
have permission to rent  (permission to rent currently only applies if the 
address is in England)  
• the address in question is ‘private rented property’, that is, accommodation  
covered by a residential tenancy agreement as defined by section 20  of the 
Immigration Act 2014 (this means that rent must be being paid for the 
accommodation, although this rent does not have to be the market rate nor 
paid by the disqualified person)  
 
Decision makers must also not apply a residence condition to a grant of immigration 
bail if the Home Office is serving a civil penalty Referral Notice or Notice of Letting to 
a Disqualified Person (NLDP) on a landlord at the address in question.  
 
When considering if it is appropriate to set a residence condition, decision makers 
may also wish to consider any landlord civil penalties or NLDPs served on the 
landlord of the property in question as relevant factors in reaching a decision.  
 
When considering whether to set a residence condition requiring an individual to live 
in private rented property , decision makers must consider any case against the 
Permission to rent criteria  which set out where the Home Office will grant permission 
to rent to migrants who do not have a right to rent. If the person meets one or more 
of the criteria, they may be granted permission to rent in accordance with the 
guidance.  
 
Full guidance on permission to rent can be found in the Permission to rent criteria .  
 
Decision makers must consider cases on what is reasonably apparent on the 
evidence clearly available, including any information which was received with any 
enquiry about permission to rent.  
 
Residence condition set by the First -tier Tribunal  
 
Permission to rent  will normally be granted to individuals who have been granted bail 
by an immigration tribunal or the courts, which contains a residence con dition and/or 
electronic monitoring condition.  
 
Presenting  Officers will manage immigration bail applications in the normal way (see: 
Immigration bail: First -tier Tribunal ) and consider whether the Home Office should 
oppose any application. Where the Tribunal or court is minded to grant immigration 
bail despite Home Office concerns, Presenting Officers may provide the courts with 
assurance that permission to rent  will be granted and Atlas  updated immediately so Page 21 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 that any check by a landlord can be managed quickly (the landlord will contact the 
Home Office landlord ’s checking service in order to establish that they may rent to 
the bailed person).  
 
Residence condition: referring cases to the Immigration 
Enforcement ( IE) Evictions Team  
 
Where a bail application has been received which meets the criteria set out below, 
the decision maker must refer it to the IE Evictions Team for consideration of 
whether a Notice of Letting to a Disqualified Person  should be served.  
 
Referrals should be made when a bail application is received and all of the following 
conditions apply:  
 
• a residential address has been provided  and the accommodation is covered 
by a residential agreement defined by section 20  of the Immigration Act 2014  
• rent is being paid (this does not have to be market rate nor being paid by the 
disqualified person)   
• the individual requires leave to enter or leave to remain and does not have it  
• the individual does not qualify for Permission to Rent    
 
For family cases, (a family is defined as having at least one or more children under 
18 years of age) cases should be referred if the family was previously complying with 
the family returns process but  has since dropped out due to non -compliance. Family 
cases where the family is complying with the Family Returns Process, or where the 
family has never been within that process, need not be referred.  
 
When considering bail in the field, Immigration Compliance and Enforcement ( ICE) 
teams should routinely consider the service of an NLDP and Right to Rent Referral 
Notice in line with guidance on these measures . 
 
Immigration bail conditions: reporting  
 
When considering imposing reporting conditions you must consider the person’s 
vulnerability, removability , any interventions necessary to facilitate case 
progression/conclusion or prompt enforcement action, risk of absconding  and 
assessed risk of harm to the general public when deciding the type and frequency of 
any reporting.  
 
There are 3 methods of reporting:  
 
• in person reporting at a reporting centre or police station  
• telephone reporting  
• digital reporting  
It is possible to for a person to be placed on more than one type of reporting.   
For further information: Reporting and Offender Management . Page 22 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 Reporting centres  
 
An in person  reporting condition, if imposed, should normally require a person to 
report to an immigration reporting centre. The Home Office has 14 immigration 
reporting centres in the London and South , North, Midlands and Wales, and 
Scotland and Northern Ireland regions. Decision makers must not set a reporting 
condition requiring a person to report to a police station if an immigration reporting 
centre is available.  
 
For further i nformation : Reporting and Offender Management .  
 
Reporting to police stations  
 
If reporting to a police station is considered essential the frequency will need to be 
agreed between the ROM and the police station (see Reporting and Offender 
Management  for more information ).  
 
If a person fails to attend a reporting event, the police will report this to the (ICE) 
team for appropriate action. The decision maker must inform the appropriate police 
station when a case is completed.  
 
Telephone reporting  
 
Telephone reporting requires an individual to be available to answer telephone calls 
during set dates and times at relevant stated frequencies. Telephone reporting also 
requires individuals to provide the Home Office with a valid mobile telephone number 
to enable reporting events to take place. The frequency of telephone reporting 
events will be set by Reporting and Offender Management (see Reporting and 
Offender Management for more information ). 
 
Digital reporting  
 
Digital reporting (IBDR) requires individuals to provide the Home Office with a valid 
mobile telephone number and or email address to enable communications to be 
received and respond to such communications sent by the Home Office via those 
methods.  
 
Caseworkers must ensure that the digital reporting bail condition is justifiable in order 
to appropriately manage the person in the community, is based on consideration of 
their specific case, and that it is reasonable to expect that the person will be able to 
comply.  
 
The administration and operational undertaking for digital reporting is the responsibility 
of the  Immigration Bail Digital Reporting (IBDR) team, however where a case owner 
exists, it is the responsibility of the case owner to ensure that the digital reporting bail 
condition is appropriate.

Consideration of digital reporting  
 
There are no general exclusions to any individuals in relation to a digital reporting  
bail condition. However, it is more likely to be suitable where a person has 
demonstrated continued compliance with immigration bail and processes. When 
making a decision whether to impose this condition, decision makers must first 
consider all forms of r eporting conditions.  
 
Consideration must be given to the risk of harm, absconding  and  case 
status/progression  weighed up against the extent of any known vulnerabilities.  
 
Technology requirements  
 
Persons considered for digital reporting must have access to a smart phone and, or 
email capabilities. Digital reporting is possible with both a smart phone and email, or 
either of these on their own.  
 
If a person does not have access to either a smart phone or email, then they are not 
able to be placed on a digital reporting condition.  
 
Contact detail verification  
 
Where decision makers are making a request to the IBDR  Team for a digital 
reporting condition to be imposed, it is the responsibility of the decision maker to 
ensure that the email and phone number have been previously verified or used for 
previous communications between the individual and the Home Office . This could be 
as part of the immigration enforcement process or as part of a previous application 
for leave to enter or remain.  
 
Where no case owner exists (for example an automated referral from wider Home 
Office departments such as Asylum and Protection) the contact details will have 
been verified at application stage.  
 
If no form of verification has taken place, the  IBDR  Team will consider the next 
appropriate steps.  
 
Frequency of digital reporting  
 
The frequency of the communications is set by the IBDR  Team  and may be monthly, 
fortnightly or weekly, dependant on the specific circumstances of the individual.  
 
Digital reporting process  
 Page 24 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 Once a person is established on digital reporting, they will receive a message to 
either their email address or their smart phone, or both, reminding them of their 
digital reporting condition which requires them to acknowledge receipt of the 
message by cli cking on the appropriate button which appears within the message.  
 
At this point if the recipient believes the Home Office has made a mistake , they have 
the opportunity to tell us that via options in the message they receive.  
 
If an individual responds to their initial message they will receive a digital receipt and 
no further action will take place.  
 
If they fail to respond to their initial message they will receive a reminder message. 
Failure to respond to the reminder message means that they will receive a 
second/final reminder message.  
 
Failure to respond following the final reminder message, and before the end of the 
reporting cycle period, means that they will be considered in breach of their digital 
reporting condition and receive a message informing them of that and the potential 
consequences.  
 
At this point the digital reporting non -compliance process will be followed.  
 
Implementation of digital reporting  
 
The decision maker must ensure that any individual identified for a digital reporting 
condition has access to the technology required.  
 
The referring officer must ensure that the most up to date and verified contact details 
are input into the correct areas within Atlas as this is the source of the contact details 
used for digital reporting.  
 
The referring office must then take the following actions in order for the IBDR  Team 
to commence digital reporting.  
 
Official – sensitive: start of section  
 
The information on this page has been removed as it is restricted for internal Home

Official – sensitive: end of section   
 
The IBDR  team will action the request and place the individual on the next 
appropriate cycle and , if required,  will serve the appropriate notices (Bail 201) to 
inform the individual of their varied bail conditions.  
 Page 25 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 Identification of digital reporting condition  
 
Persons who are subject to digital reporting can be identified by having an open bail 
condition relating to digital reporting within Atlas.  
 
To identify if the person is engaging with the digital reporting condition, the 
engagement screen will indicate whether the person is ‘in contact’ or ‘out of contact’.  
 
Recipient options – Not for me  
 
A person who receives a digital reporting message and does not believe it relates to 
them or believes that their circumstances have changed, which makes the bail 
condition incorrect, can inform the IBDR  Team via options in the message they 
receive.  The options available to them are:  
 
• they have been informed by a Home Office employee that they no longer 
have digital reporting conditions  
• they have recently obtained permission to stay in the UK  
• they have recently left the UK  
• they believe they have a right to reside in the UK  
• any other reason they believe they are not subject to digital reporting 
conditions  
 
Should an individual select one of these options instead of acknowledging bail, the 
IBDR  team will contact the case owner, or where no case owner exists investigate 
the circumstances and take the appropriate actions.  
 
Changes to contact details  
 
Following acknowledgement of their digital reporting bail condition via the required 
response to the digital reporting message, an individual can submit a change of 
contact details via the digital reporting messaging service. Only changes to email 
address and phone numbers can be submitted.  
 
Should an individual submit a change of contact details, the IBDR  team will contact 
the case owner, or where no case owner exists investigate the circumstances and 
take the appropriate actions, which may include verification of the new contact 
details.  
 
Ceasing the digital reporting condition  
 
If a case owner wishes to end bail (for example if the person leaves the UK or is 
granted some form of leave to remain), or if they wish to vary the immigration bail 
conditions to no longer include digital reporting, a request should be submitted to the 
IBDR team.

Official – sensitive: end of section  
 
The case owner must then take the appropriate immigration bail actions to inform the 
person of the changes to their immigration bail conditions as set out in Varying 
immigration bail conditions and take the appropriate Atlas actions.  
 
Non-compliance with digital reporting  
 
If the person fails to acknowledge the digital reporting messages they receive (by 
clicking the appropriate button within the messages) and any reminders, then they 
are considered in breach of their digital reporting bail condition.  
 
The person will receive an automated notice informing them that they are now in 
breach of their digital reporting bail condition. Within this notice, the individual is 
given an opportunity to provide representations against the breach. Should 
representatio n be received these will be forwarded to the case owner or considered 
by the IBDR t eam.  
 
The case owner will be informed that the person has breached their digital reporting 
condition and Atlas will be updated to reflect the lack of engagement.  
 
The person will remain on the digital reporting condition and continue to receive the ir 
digital reporting  messages until the case owner varies bail and requests the digital 
reporting condition is ceased.  
 
Should the person who has failed to comply with digital reporting not have a case 
owner, they will remain on digital reporting until they are assigned a case owner 
(where a review of bail conditions will take place), or for an appropriate timescale, 
whilst  ever they are considered to be within the active illegal population. The IBDR 
team can, at their discretion also take any of the actions as appropriate in line with 
those options available for case owners.  
 
Immigration bail conditions: electronic monitoring  
 
An electronic monitoring (EM) c ondition is a condition that requires the bailed person 
to cooperate with any arrangements the Secretary of State specifies for detecting 
and recording by electronic means one or more of the following. The bailed person’s:  
 
• location at specified times, during specified periods of time or while the 
arrangements are in place  
• presence in a location at specified times, during specified periods of time or 
while the arrangements are in place  
• absence from a location at specified times, during specified periods of time or 
while arrangements are in place  
 Page 27 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 The arrangements with which the person must cooperate may include the bailed 
person:  
 
• wearing an electronic monitoring device and facilitating arrangements for its 
detection, which may include installation of electronic monitoring equipment at 
a specified address, and presenting a device upon request by an authorised 
officer  
• making specified use of an electronic monitoring device  communicating in a 
specified manner and at specified times or during specified periods  
• allowing people other than the Secretary of State or the First -tier Tribunal to 
exercise electronic monitoring functions  
 
EM devices  
 
The Home Offices uses Global Positioning System (GPS) devices to electronically 
trail monitor a person’s movements.  
 
Two types of EM device s that use GPS technology are available to the Home Office : 
 
• fitted device – a traditional tag fitted to the ankle  – the device vibrates to alert 
the wearer that they need to charge the device or to warn them that they are 
breaching a supplementary condition , for example,  entering an exclusion zone  
• non-fitted device – this device fits in the palm of the hand  – in addition to 
recording trail data, it can take fingerprints and will give a sound and vibrate 
alert to notify the person that their biometrics must be submitted  – the device 
reads the fingerprint and compares this to the fingerprint captured when the 
device was issued  – although the device is not fitted to the person, they are 
required to carry the device with them  – requests for fingerprints are made on 
a random basis several times throughout  the day to verify that the device is 
being carried as required  – this requirement must be included within the 
person’s bail conditions  
 
The Secretary of State will make the decision regarding the type of device to be 
used. When considering any representations received, regard will be had to which 
type of device should be used, subject to the appropriateness of bail conditions 
proposed, but  it will not be open to the person or a representative acting on their 
behalf to specify the device type.  
 
Where a person is granted immigration bail subject to an EM condition, they should 
initially have a fitted device issued to them. However, there may be some cases 
where a non -fitted device may be considered a more appropriate choice based on 
their individu al circumstances. A person may be moved between device types whilst 
subject to EM, and regular EM reviews will consider whether a person should be 
transferred between device types. Criteria for this consideration are set out below in 
EM and linked Supplementary Conditions: review . 
 
Both devices require the person to regularly charge the device and comply with other 
conditions set out in their immigration bail notice. Failure to comply with immigration Page 28 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 bail conditions constitutes a breach and should be considered in line with the 
guidance at Breach of EM immigration bail conditions . 
 
The fitted device working in conjunction with the monitoring system is capable of 
monitoring whether a person complies with the supplementary conditions set out in 
Immigration bail supplementary conditions: curfews, inclusion or exclusion zones . 
These supplementary conditions will only be set and monitored where identified in a 
person’s immigration bail conditions, with one exception. Where a person is resident 
in Northern Ireland an exclusion zone will be set at the border with the Republic of 
Ireland, as there is no power in law to monitor a person outside of the UK. Entering 
the exclusion zone of the Republic of Ireland will not be treated as a breach of EM. 
However, case owners will need to be aware that the fact that a person has left the 
UK may be evidence that a person has affected their Deportation Order/Removal or 
where no Deportation Order has been signed, ceased the deportation/removal 
process.  
 
Where the person is not issued with a HMU a mobile phone will be issued to the 
person to allow contact to and from the EM supplier. The EM supplier will provide the 
person with information relating to the use and maintenance of the mobile phone.  
 
In very limited cases the Home Office may make an operational decision to use a 
Radio Frequency (RF) device rather than a GPS device but only w here the Home 
Office deem  it necessary to ensure  public safety . In such cases it will be necessary 
to install a HMU and set a curfew in order to ensure that the device functions as 
intended. The individual must have an address to which they will be bailed and the 
owner must agree to the installation of the HMU. The l ength of curfew will be 
determined based on the ind ividual’s personal circumstances.  
 
Issuing devices  
 
The Secretary of State will make the decision on place of device fitting/issue, based 
on practicality grounds including consideration of location and vulnerabilities. Where 
a person is placed on EM following a grant of bail from detention, their EM device 
should be fitted/issued at the point of release. However, where this is not practicable, 
or where the person is detained in a prison in Scotland or Northern Ireland, this may 
happen at the persons residence or a reporting centre.  
 
Where a person is on immigration bail that has been varied to include EM, their 
device may be fitted or issued at a reporting centre, or the person’s place of 
residence. This will be communicated to them prior to the appointment.  
 
For practicality reasons, to manage the roll out of non -fitted devices and ensure the 
service is efficient, the service will be rolled out by region with devices issued at 
reporting events. A roll out schedule will be provided to staff, and devices should not 
be issued outside of this schedule without agreement with the EM supplier, sought 
through the EM Hub.   
 
Failure to comply with the appointment or fitting of a device without reasonable 
excuse is considered a breach of bail, see Non-compliance with immigration bail: 
administrative penalties.  Page 29 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
  
Electronic monitoring (EM) duty  
 
The Immigration Act 2016 Schedule 10 Part 1 paragraphs 2(2) and 2(3) place a duty 
on the Secretary of State to electronically monitor those on immigration bail who 
could be detained because they are subject to either deportation proceedings or a 
Deportation Order.  
 
The duty should be applied unless its application  would breach Convention Rights or 
it would not be practical to do so. (Referred to within this document as ‘the duty’).  
 
Convention rights should be considered to mean Human Rights under the Human 
Rights Act 1998 and European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  
 
For further guidance on considering whether the duty should be applied, see Use of 
EM, Representations  and Electronic monitoring: individuals subject to the duty.  
 
The duty to impose EM was commenced as follows:  
 
• 31 August 2021 to those newly released on immigration bail in England and 
Wales  
• 31 January 2022 to those in England and Wales who had been made subject 
to immigration bail before 31 August 2021  
• 31 August 2022 to those resident in Scotland and Northern Ireland

Use of EM  
 
Electronic monitoring can apply to any person granted immigration bail if justified by 
the individual circumstances of the case.  Where the duty does not apply, EM is more 
likely to be appropriate as a condition of bail where a person poses a high risk of 
harm to the public on the basis of criminality and/or in cases concerning national 
security  but is not limited to those cases . Where the duty does not apply EM is less 
likely to be appropriate in any case where a person is granted immigration bail from Page 30 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 a position of liberty (for example, where the  person has had a valid in -time, in -
country application refused) . 
 
EM must not be imposed:  
 
• on a person under the age of 18  
• following detention under Sections 37 or 41 of the Mental Health Act 1983 
where the person remains subject to a supervision order  
 
EM may be accompanied by one or more of the following supplementary conditions:  
 
• a curfew (requirement to remain at a specified address during specified 
periods of time)  
• an inclusion or exclusion zone (requirement to remain within, or not to enter, a 
specified area)  
 
For guidance on applying supplementary conditions, see Immigration bail 
supplementary conditions: curfews, inclusion or exclusion zones . 
 
When considering the conditions of release on immigration bail the First -tier Tribunal 
may impose an EM condition on a person where they think it is an appropriate 
condition irrespective of whether the Secretary of State has requested this.  
 
When granting immigration bail subject to EM the First -tier Tribunal is not required to 
impose any supplementary conditions requested by the Secretary of State , that is,  a 
curfew or an inclusion or exclusion zone unless it sees fit to impose such conditions.  
 
Individual business areas have additional  criteria to assist in identifying suitable 
cases and these are outlined in further detail below : 
 
• whether there is strong independent medical evidence to suggest that an EM 
condition would cause serious harm to the person’s mental or physical health  
• whether a claim of torture been accepted by the Home Office or a Court  
• whether there has been a positive conclusive grounds decision in respect of a 
claim to be a victim of modern slavery  
• whether the person’s mental capacity is deemed to be a bar to understanding 
the EM conditions and therefore their ability to comply for example, a person 
suffering with dementia  
• whether the individual is pregnant (18 weeks plus) or has recently given birth 
(within the last 3 months)  
• whether the individual is suffering with phlebitis or similar conditions which 
cause swelling of the lower legs  
• whether the individual is showing any signs of frailty or age -related conditions 
which may impact on the person’s ability to wear and/or maintain the device  
 
Meeting one or more criteria on the above list should prompt the decision maker to 
consider whether EM is an appropriate course of action but does not in itself prohibit 
imposing such a condition. In many cases, even where there is some evidence in 
favour of removing EM, on balance it may still be appropriate to maintain EM due to Page 31 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 the other factors present in the case.  Where one or more of the above conditions 
apply there must be a clear statement why EM is still considered suitable, and this 
must be agreed by at least an  SEO. . 
 
The above list is not exhaustive: decision makers must consider the individual 
circumstances of each case. If you identify a case which would otherwise appear to 
be suitable for EM but there are factors in the case which cause you to question 
suitability, please seek advice from your team leader. Where the duty applies, 
decisions not to apply an EM condition for reasons not listed above must receive 
Deputy Director authority. Where the duty does not apply, the decision must be 
made at SEO level or above.  
 
It is expected that in any claims linked to either mental or physical health issues that 
medical evidence will be made available to substantiate that claim. It may be 
necessary to delay a decision to await medical evidence however, that delay should 
be of no more than 28 days. If no evidence is forthcoming the end of at that period a 
decision should be made, and EM applied if appropriate in the known circumstances. 
Any decision should be reviewed upon receipt of any further evidence within 1 4 days 
of receip t. 
 
Vulnerability considerations  
 
The table below sets out some  considerations that may be required to establish 
whether there is a disproportionate breach of a person’s rights under Article 8 of 
ECHR either by the imposition of EM or the type of device to be imposed. This must 
not be used at a stand -alone guide, and i ts use must be in conjunction with the 
detailed guidance in Use of EM  above.  Neither the conditions nor the considerations 
listed are exhaustive.

Electronic monitoring: individuals subject to the duty  
 
Decision makers must always impose an EM condition if the FNO is subject to the 
duty and to do so would not breach their Convention Rights , see Use of EM , or be 
impractical , see Practical reasons . The decision maker may also request additional 
supplementary conditions if the facts of the case warrant it , see Immigration bail 
supplementary conditions: curfews, inclusion or exclusion zones . 
 
Any decision to not apply the duty must be authorised by at least an  SEO  where it is 
for a reason listed in Use of EM . A decision not to apply the duty for any other 
reason must receive at least Deputy Director authority. Such a decision must be 
supported by consideration of why either the use of EM would be a disproportionate 
breach of either the person’s Convention Rights or is not practical in that particular 
case.  
 
Where it is proposed to apply the duty but by way of a non -fitted device from the 
outset this should be agreed at a minimum of HEO level.  
 
Where  the duty applies to a person being deported solely based on a failed 
application to remain on the basis of marriage to an EEA national the decision maker Page 35 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 should consider whether such condition would be compatible with the individual’s 
Convention Rights. Should it be considered that EM should be used this must be 
agreed at Deputy Director level.  
 
Irrespective of the decision the case record must clearly indicate that EM has been 
considered as a condition of bail.  
 
When considering the conditions of release on immigration bail the First -tier Tribunal 
must impose an EM condition on a person subject to the duty unless the Secretary of 
State has stated that it should not be imposed. Where immigration bail is granted by 
the Tribunal,  but the grant of bail is silent on the issue of EM (and the Secretary of 
State has not stated that it should not be imposed), the following is appropriate:  
 
• if management of bail has been transferred to the Secretary of State EM will 
be imposed on the basis outlined in the bail summary  
• if management of bail has not been transferred the case owner must refer 
back to the First -tier Tribunal and request a variation of bail with EM as a 
condition in line with the legislation as set out in Variation of bail by the 
Tribunal   
 
Where bail is sought through the First -tier Tribunal the Home Office will request that 
there be a maximum 72 -hour delay to release in order for EM arrangements to be 
put in place and  where applicable  to facilitate fitting the device at the point of release.  
There is however an exception to this rule if those held in the Dungavel Immigration 
Removal Centre ( IRC) have a bail hearing on a Thursday and, if released with EM 
arrangements in place, will be travelling to a Northern Ireland (NI) based address. In 
this instance the Presenting Officer will request for the release to happen on a 
Monday, for the reason there are no public transport options in NI on a Sunday (72 
hours after the decision is made) which would make travelling to their destination 
very challe nging.  
 
Practical reasons  
 
In accordance with Schedule 10, the Secretary of State may decide not to impose an 
EM condition if the Secretary of State considers that to do so would be impractical.  
 
Paragraph 2(9) of Schedule 10 of the Immigration Act 2016 sets out matters that the 
Secretary of State may in particular have regard to, when considering whether it 
would be impractical to impose electronic monitoring (or continue to impose 
electronic moni toring) where a person is subject to the duty. These are:  
 
• any obstacles to making electronic monitoring arrangements in relation to the 
person  
• the resources that are available for imposing electronic monitoring conditions 
on persons to whom the EM duty applies and for managing the operation of 
the electronic monitoring  
• the need to give priority to the use of those resources in relation to particular 
categories of persons to whom the EM duty applies  
• the matters listed in paragraph 3(2) as they apply to the person (as set out in 
Exercising the power to grant immigration bail ) Page 36 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
  
There will be fewer devices available than the number of individuals subject to the 
duty, and fewer fitted devices available than non -fitted devices. As a result, there will 
be a need to regulate the use of devices. Cases identified as being in most need of 
monitoring will be prioritised for EM conditions as follows:  
 
• foreign national offenders in the following order:  
o those who are considered to pose very high  harm to the public  
o those who are considered to pose high harm to the public  
o those who are considered to pose medium  harm to the public  
o those who are considered to pose low harm to the public  
• foreign nationals subject to deportation with assurances  
• foreign nationals who have entered in breach of a deportation order  
• EU nationals and/or their family members subject to deportation  
 
Where the duty applies to a person already subject to immigration bail due regard 
shall be given to the length of time which has elapsed since release and the person’s 
compliance with immigration bail during that period. Those persons who are 
considered to  pose less risk of harm, have been consistently compliant with bail 
conditions and have been subject to immigration bail for over 12 months are less 
likely to be prioritised whilst those persons who are considered to pose a high risk of 
harm, have failed t o comply  / consistently comply with their bail conditions may be 
considered a priority irrespective of the length of time they have already spent on 
immigration bail. It does not however, prohibit the use of EM in such cases where 
either resources are available or th ere are other reasons to believe that EM provides 
the most effective way in which to maintain contact.  
 
Electronic monitoring: individuals not subject to the duty  
 
It is not usual practice to seek an EM condition where a person is not subject to the 
duty. However, there may be occasions where the individual is considered to be of 
such risk of absconding and to pose such risk of harm that an EM condition would be 
nece ssary and proportionate.  
 
As part of that consideration, the following must be taken into account to ensure that 
there are no practical bars to applying EM: where a Justice Department imposes EM 
conditions  (where a person is subject to EM imposed by the Ministry of Justice or the 
Justice Departments of Scotland or Northern Ireland) and where the EM address is 
considered unsuitable.  
 
In these cases, you must obtain authority from your Deputy Director to seek an EM 
condition. It is also possible for the First -tier Tribunal to impose an EM condition of its 
own initiative (that is, where this has not been requested by the Home Office). Where 
it is considered following a review of EM that it is no longer suitable to monitor the 
person you must obtain SEO authority.  
 
Representations  
 Page 37 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 Prior to a final decision to  apply electronic monitoring  as a condition  of bail , with or 
without supplementary conditions, representations must be invited from the person. 
The below sets out the representations process , forms  and timescales for different 
scenarios.  A decision to vary bail from a fitted to non -fitted device does not require 
the invitation of representations.  
 
Where a person is already subject to immigration bail:  
 
• if the person is being considered for a variation of bail to apply an electronic 
monitoring condition, they must be given 10 working days to provide 
representations irrespective of whether the duty applies  
• if the person is being considered for  transfer from a RF to a GPS device the y 
must be given 10 working days to provide representations  
• if the person has breached bail whilst on a non -fitted device and as part of that 
breach action is being considered for a variation of bail to a fitted device they 
must be given 10 working days to provide representations  
 
Where a person is detained:  
 
• if authority has been given on behalf of the Secretary of State to grant 
immigration bail and it is considered that such bail should be subject to EM, the 
case worker must  invite representations from the person concerning EM and 
any supplementary conditions  - the person must be given 3 working days to 
provide representations  
 
Where a person was previously subject to an EM condition of bail, but was then 
detained for a brief period, and is then to be released again on bail, it will not be 
necessary to seek representations in the following circumstances:  
 
• where the person has been detained for less than 2 weeks  and, either:  
o release is the result of legal proceedings being lodged  
o release follows completion of a travel documentation exercise  
• removal by chartered or scheduled flight has been cancelled for a reason other 
than the individual’s non -compliance  
• the decision maker is not aware of any new information which may impact on 
the use of EM (see below)  
 
Before release subject to an EM condition is authorised in the above circumstances, 
consideration m ust be given to any information revealed during the brief period of 
detention which may have an impact on the use of EM. This includes any information 
provided within representations which have led to release, or any information in 
regard to vulnerabilitie s, including information received from healthcare.  
 
In all cases regard must be had to the matters set out in Exercising the power to 
grant immigration bail , and the guidance set out in Use of EM . 
 
Representations should be invited using the following forms:  
 
• BAIL 211 where a provisional decision has been made to grant bail to a 
detained person and apply a particular GPS EM condition/supplementary Page 38 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 condition or to vary a person’s bail to include a particular EM 
condition/supplementary conditions  
• BAIL 212 where in the rare event that for public safety reasons a Radio 
Frequency device is considered appropriate  
• BAIL 213 where the person is subject to the duty but is in immigration detention 
and a decision has not yet been made to grant them bail  
• BAIL 214 where the person is subject to the duty but is currently on immigration 
bail or in a position of liberty  
 
Where no representations have been received following service of a B AIL 214, and 
the person is already in a position of liberty, they should be provided with a B AIL 211 
prior to the application of EM if supplementary conditions are to be applied or where 
more than 3 months have passed since the deadline for submitting representations.  
 
Considering representations  
 
Any representations received within the response timeframe must be considered  
when making a  final decision regarding the imposition of EM or a supplementary 
condition.  Decisions should be made based on the information provided in addition 
to information already known about the person  with the response provided on a Bail 
215. In all cases regard must be had to the matters set out in Exercising the power to 
grant immigration bail , and the guidance set out in Use of EM . 
 
Representations must be considered and responded to in a timely manner 
prioritising  cases where the person is already subject to EM and there is an 
indication that there is an immediate physical danger to the person followed by those 
whose release is imminent. Where representations were received within the stated 
response timeframe and the person is already on immigration bail the decision 
should be notified to the individual within 28 days of receipt of the representations.  
 
Where representations were received within the stated response timeframe and the 
person is detained, the decision maker should seek to make the decision at least 3 
days (excluding weekends) prior to that release date and notify the individual of the 
outcom e. 
 
Decisions should be made on the information provided in addition to information 
already known about the person , and responses provided on a BAIL 215. In all 
cases regard must be had to the matters set out in Exercising the power to grant 
immigration bail , and the guidance set out in Use of EM . It should not normally be 
appropriate to seek any further information in order to make a decision , but where it 
is necessary, a decision should be notified to the individual within 14 days of either 
the information being received or the target date for responding (whichever comes 
first). If the person or their representative has indicated that medical information is to 
follow the representations a delay may occur to facilitate this , but a decision should 
not be delayed more than 28 days.  
 
Where  representations are received after the response date and  the EM Supplier 
has already been tasked to fit the device that order will continue to be implemented 
and a decision will be made after the implementation. Where the EM Supplier has 
not already been tasked a decision will be made before tasking proceeds.  Page 39 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
  
Where it is considered that the EM condition against which the representations were 
raised is disproportionate the immigration bail conditions must be varied and served 
on the person, additionally the EM supplier must be advised that the condition should 
be ceased with immediate effect.  
 
In cases where representations have been made against a curfew condition, 
inclusion or exclusion zone the final decision whether to proceed with the proposed 
condition must be made at no lower than SEO level.  
 
Levels of authority  for use of EM  
 
To ensure that appropriate decisions are made in relation to the use of EM certain 
key decisions will need the authority of a senior officer as set out below:  
 
Decision being 
made  Does duty 
apply  Minimum authorising grade  
To apply the duty  Yes HEO  
To apply the duty 
where deportation is 
solely following 
refusal of application 
based on marriage to 
an EEA national  Yes Deputy Director  
Not to apply the EM 
duty upon release for 
a reason listed in 
Use of EM  Yes  SEO  
Not to apply the EM

duty does not apply  No Deputy Director  
Decision to cease 
monitoring  in all 
cases   Yes/No SEO  
 Page 40 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 The grades listed above are the minimum level of authority required. Dependent on 
the circumstances of the case, in particular the risk of harm posed by an individual, it 
may be appropriate to seek authority at a higher grade.  
 
Where a Justice Department imposes  EM conditions  
 
Where a person is subject to EM conditions imposed as part of their management by 
the Ministry of Justice or the Justice Department of Scotland or Northern Ireland the 
following approach should be taken (whether or not the EM duty applies):  
 
England and Wales  – the Home Office uses the EM contract managed by the 
Ministry of Justice therefore it is possible for both the Home Office and another law 
enforcement agency such as HMPPS to have different EM conditions monitored 
through a single GPS device. Any breache s of EM conditions will be notified only to 
the agency which requested them. For example , the Home Office will only be notified 
of breaches of the conditions they requested and HMPPS would be notified only of 
the breaches of the conditions  they requested.  In these instances , the use of non -
fitted devices will not be suitable whilst the other order is in place.  
 
Scotland and Northern Ireland  – both Scotland and Northern Ireland use EM as 
part of their approach to Justice management. Each country has a separate EM 
contract to deliver this service, and both rely on the use of Radio Frequency 
technology. The Home Office does not have access to t he devices provided through 
these contracts and it is therefore not possible to monitor through a single device. 
The imposition of 2 separate EM devices at the same time should be avoided. In 
order to ensure that there is effec tive management of a person’s rehabilitation and/or 
contact management whilst subject to criminal bail the following approaches should 
be taken:  
 
• the Home Office will, for practical reasons, not impose EM whilst an electronic 
monitoring order imposed by a Scottish or Northern Ireland department is in 
force  - in cases where that that order is part of a licence or sentence the Home 
Office will be notified when that order is due to cease  - if it is considered that 
there are no exemptions to applying the duty the Home Office will seek to 
implement the duty the working day after the Scottish or Northern Ireland order 
ceases  
• where the person is subject to EM by the Home Office and is either remanded 
by the Court on EM or convicted and sentenced to a Community Order 
including EM the Home Office will cease its EM and will consider re -
implementation as soon as possible after the o rder imposed by the Court has 
expired  
 
Where a person is subject to EM by another law enforcement agency and is to be 
subject to EM as a condition of their immigration bail, either in conjunction with the 
existing EM in England and Wales or where the existing EM is due to cease, 
representations  must be sought. For more details see Electronic monitoring – 
Representations.  
 Page 41 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 Electronic monitoring: implementation  
 
See also: Immigration bail supplementary conditions: curfews, inclusion or exclusion 
zones.   
 
The decision maker must inform the person  of their responsibilities regarding EM 
(and, if applicable, their supplementary conditions) both before and after the EM 
induction has taken place in order to answer any questions or concerns that an 
individual may have about the process  and inform how their data can be used . 
 
These are as follows:  
 
• being present at the specified address during a fixed period in order for EM 
equipment to be installed  
• reading and fully understanding the handbook  that is given to them – this 
explains their EM condition in detail and how their personal data will be used  
• reading and fully understanding the conditions which relate to their immigration 
bail including how to maintain the device  
• maintaining their EM device and any mobile phone issued to them as outlined 
in the handbook  issued by the supplier to include charging the device daily until 
fully charged  
• not damaging/allowing another to damage the EM device or preventing/allowing 
another to prevent the EM device to function as intended  
• contacting the monitoring centre and the decision maker immediately if 
problems occur with their telephone line, tag or monitoring equipment  
• providing biometric data when alerted to do so by their non -fitted device  
• ensuring that they report at the times and days specified in their BAIL 201  
• in the event of an emergency which means that they have to enter an exclusion 
zone or leave an inclusion zone, they must notify the decision maker and the 
monitoring centre either during the emergency or as soon as possible thereafter  
• in the event of an emergency which means that they have to leave home and 
are unable to be monitored electronically during any curfew period, they must 
notify the decision maker and the monitoring centre either during the 
emergency or as soon as possible t hereafter:  
o decision makers must make individuals aware that they would need to prove 
the emergency in the form of documentary evidence, for example, medical 
certificate  
• trail data will be held by the EM supplier but may be accessed by the Home 
Office where one or more of the following applies and where proportionate and 
justified in the circumstances in accordance with data protection law:  
o a breach of immigration bail conditions has occurred, or intelligence 
suggests a breach has occurred to consider what action should be taken in 
response to a breach up to and including prosecution  
o where a breach of immigration bail conditions has occurred, which has

The EM Supplier will notify the EM Hub of the outcome of address suitability 
assessments and inductions. The EM Hub will then notify the decision maker and 
update Atlas . 
 
If induction is successful, there is no further action required by the decision maker in 
relation to the commencement of EM services.  
 
EM address considered unsuitable  
 
When seeking accommodation for a person you must refer to the guidance on 
accommodation (see Immigration bail –interim guidance ) in the first instance to 
ensure that the person is accommodated in the most suitable setting.  
 
If the EM contractor reports that a proposed immigration bail address is deemed 
unsuitable for EM services, the EM Hub will notify the decision maker that an 
alternative address is needed to install EM equipment. The relevant sections of the 
BAIL 206 (see Electronic monitoring: additional requirements  for further information) 
must be issued to end the live EM order with the EM supplier.  
 
The decision maker must then consider how to proceed with the case, seeking 
assistance as necessary from their managers. Further consideration may be given to 
whether an EM condition remains necessary for a grant of bail and, if so, what 
alternative addres s could be sourced for the person. If a new address is sourced, a 
new tagging order must be made , and a fresh BAIL 206 completed. This scenario is 
more likely to occur where a HMU is required to be installed owing to the presence of 
a curfew, although in s ome cases a poor GPS signal may also make the property 
unsuitable.  
 
Accommodation where a person has been referred into the National 
Referral Mechanism  
 
EM is acceptable in safe house accommodation provided to those who are being  
supported by the Home Office Modern Slavery Victim Care Contract (implemented 
by The Salvation Army) , where that is the appropriate accommodation in line with the 
MSVCC accommodation policy set through the Modern Slavery Statutory Guidance . 
In all cases regard must be had to the matters set out in Exercising the power to 
grant immigration bail , and the guidance set out in Use of EM . 
 
No fixed abode  
 
The lack of a permanent address is not an exemption under the duty. Consideration 
must be given to both the person’s personal circumstances and the practical 
implications of requiring regular charging. This includes whether the person has 
access to accommodation but not a regular address, whether the person is street Page 43 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 homeless  and whether the person has access to an electrical supply on a daily basis 
(or at least every other day).  
 
Where it is considered appropriate to apply the duty the default address to be used is 
the ROM to which the person will be reporting. Checks will be made at the first 
reporting event and at the point of any EM reviews to establish whether the person 
now ha s a stable address and if so ensure that personal records are updated.  
 
Failed EM inductions  
 
The Home Office will seek to have an EM device fitted at the point of release 
wherever this is practical. Where this is not practical the device will be fitted at the 
person’s home address.  
 
The EM supplier will attend the specified address to apply the EM device to the 
bailed person. If the supplier is unable to complete this induction, the supplier will 
notify the EM Hub of the failure. Where the person is being released from detention 
the implementation of EM will be a condition of release onto bail and as a result 
consideration must be given to whether release can continue. The decision maker 
will need to consider the reason for failure , for example,  was it because  of non -
compliance on the part of the individual, failure of the equipment etc, consideration 
must also be given to how long it may take to resolve an issue such as equipment 
failure. The decision maker will then choose one of the following options:  
 
• serve detention paperwork for those due for release from custodial sentence  
• maintain detention for those being released from immigration detention (it may 
be necessary to provide new detention papers to the place of detention  
• allow release to continue on the understanding that the device will be fitted at 
the home address at a specified date and time  
 
The EM supplier will automatically arrange a second attempt to fit the device. The 
decision maker must request that the EM Hub notifies the EM supplier if the location 
for fitting has been amended. If the second attempt to induct the bailed person is 
succe ssful, no further action is required by the decision maker in this regard.  
 
However, if the second attempt fails, the EM supplier will make no further attempt to 
install the EM equipment or apply the EM device to the bailed person. The supplier 
will notify the EM Hub of the failure. The EM Hub will notify the decision maker and 
request BAIL 206 is completed to end the tagging order with the EM supplier.  
 
The decision maker must investigate the reasons for failure to induct before 
requesting further induction visits. If these enquiries indicate the bailed person has 
absconded, attempts to implement EM must cease and the absconder process must 
be followed.  
 
If these enquiries indicate the bailed person is unable to access the property for 
some reason, the decision maker must consider asking the bailed person to provide 
an alternative address before re -instigating the EM service.  
 Page 44 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 If the enquiries confirm the bailed person is residing at the address, a new BAIL 206 
must be completed and resubmitted to the EM Hub for their action.  
 
If a second round of attempts to induct the bailed person fail, more detailed enquiries 
must be made. It may be necessary, following any enquiries being made, to consider 
alternatives to EM at this stage including but not limited to the application of 
sanc tions for non -compliance with Immigration Bail. For further information see Non-
compliance with immigration bail: administrative penalties . 
 
Where a HMU is also required and the bailed person fails to comply with a request to 
allow entry to the EM Supplier, the EM Supplier will notify the EM Hub of the failure 
to install the HMU and will re -schedule one further visit. Failure to comply with the  
installation of an HMU will be considered as a breach of bail conditions and 
consideration will be given whether to take further action against the person.  
 
Electronic Monitoring:  additional requirements  
 
If the First -tier Tribunal or Secretary of State grants bail with EM conditions, the 
caseworker must task the EM Hub on Atlas with producing the release paperwork 
and arranging EM induction at source. The  caseworker must also ensure a recent 
Police National Computer (PNC) check has been conducted on the person to be 
tagged – a PNC check is required because of the Home Office duty of care to the 
contractor – the contractor will use this information when ris k assessing the 
proposed induction, instructions for  PNC checks are dependent on existing local 
arrangements . 
 
The EM Hub produces the Notification to Contractor of New (or Variation to Existing) 
Electronic Monitoring Condition form (BAIL 206) and forwards it to by email to EMS.  
 
As part of this process the EM Hub must:  
 
• ensure that a photograph of the person is attached to the BAIL 206 in order that 
the EM Contractor can identify the correct person to induct and tag  
• ensure that there is a harm assessment which highlights any violent behaviour  
• identify the person’s gender to ensure that where the person is  / identifies as 
female, a female member of the supplier’s staff is present at the induction  
• provide the EM Hub’s contact details on the BAIL 206 :

The decision maker is responsible for ensuring decisions have the appropriate 
authorisation and Atlas is updated correctly.  
 Page 45 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 The EM Hub will check the appropriate authority has been given for the use of EM 
and any supplementary conditions and will complete the BAIL 206. Any paperwork 
without an appropriate authorisation, or which is incomplete, will be returned to the 
case owner  for remedial action. The EM Hub mailbox is constantly monitored in 
working hours and any paperwork which requires amendment will be returned to the 
caseworker within 24 hours.  
 
Once the EM Hub is satisfied that the paperwork is correct, it will refer the case to 
the EM Contractor to arrange induction of the bailed person.  
 
EM and linked Supplementary Conditions : review  
 
See also: Varying immigration bail conditions . 
 
The use of EM and any linked supplementary conditions of curfews, inclusion zones 
or exclusion zones  require regular monitoring to ensure that they remain 
proportionate.  
 
Where  the duty applies and  there are no practicality issues , the duty to monitor the 
person applies unless a proportionality argument outweighs the legislative 
requirement to use EM.  
 
Whilst the review of EM will typically be undertaken by the EM Hub where the 
responsible decision -making  unit is FNO RC it is essential that all decision makers 
ensure that there is regular review of EM. Directorates other than FNO RC must 
review their own EM cases unless an agreement has been made with the EM Hub to 
review cases on their behalf.  
 
The use of EM and all supplementary conditions to EM must be reviewed by a 
decision maker in any case allocated to them:  
 
•  every 4 months   
• when they receive any representations on the matter, including requests to vary 
the condition, from the individual or a person acting on their behalf  
• when a request is made by another decision maker  
 
The purpose of the review is to ensure that the individual remains suitable for both 
EM and any supplementary condition or conditions and any EM or conditions 
continue to be necessary and proportionate in consideration of  the facts at the date 
the review is undertak en. The review will also provide an opportunity to consider 
whether the device type remains the most appropriate.  In all cases regard must be 
had to the matters set out in Exercising the power to grant immigration bail , and the 
guidance set out in Use of EM . It will be necessary to consider movement between 
devices in both directions such as  from fitted to non -fitted as well as non -fitted to  
 fitted.  
Factors to be taken into consideration will include, but are not limited to:  
 
• the overall time spent on EM  
• the time on the particular device type  Page 46 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 • the risk of absconding  
• the risk of harm posed to the public  
• the risk of re -offending  
• the expected time until removal  
• any vulnerabilities  
• compliance with immigration bail  
 
Compliance with immigration bail  
 
A person’s compliance with both their immigration bail conditions , immigration 
control and the criminal justice system will provide an indication of the person’s 
likelihood to remain in contact with the Home Office whilst their immigration matters 
are bought to conclusion. The less compliant a person, irrespective of the factors 
considered above, the more likely that they would remain on EM for a longer period. 
Where compliance has been low or intermittent whilst on a non -fitted device this 
should prompt co nsideration of the use of a fitted device. Particular consideration 
should be given to any periods where the person has sought to avoid contact by 
failing to charge their EM device or has in some way tampered with the device or its 
ability to operate properly. Where a person has damaged or broken two non-fitted 
devices or more, this should result in consideration of the use of  a fitted device 
unless doing so  would be unsuitable or impractical. Additionally, regard should be 
had to whether the person has attempted to abscond or evade immigration control or 
if there has there been a significant change in either personal circumstances or in 
the progress of their case that indicates that they may no w pose a higher or lower 
risk of absconding. Examples may include where appeal rights have been exhausted 
or there have been multiple representations which have been rejected or removal is 
no longer imminent.  
 
When considering whether it is appropriate to cease monitoring or  change their 
device type and the person was placed on EM following a period of liberty (not 
including those released and tagged at home as part of their release conditions) 
consideration should be given to their general compliance with their bail conditions 
and case management pri or to release. Where the person was fully compliant before 
EM and has continued to remain compliant this should be considered when making a 
decision . 
 
The imminency of removal should be considered in tandem with compliance with 
immigration bail.  
 
The risk of re -offending  
 
It is appropriate to consider whether the person has re -offended whilst being subject 
to EM and any information that suggests that they still pose a risk of re -offending. 
Consideration should be given to whether the person is subject to MAPPA or 
JIGSAW arr angements. If such arrangements are in place the relevant panel should 
be asked for their views on the potential cessation of EM or transfer from a fitted to a 
non-fitted device. It should be stressed that whilst the panels views are being sought 
their res ponse will be considered along with other factors and the final decision may 
not be in line with their recommendation.  Page 47 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
  
Vulnerabilities  
 
Evidence of vulnerability should always be considered , particularly as they can 
change over time . This includes any new vulnerabilities that have been brought to 
notice since the previous review and any evidence that there has been a worsening 
of any known medical conditions. A vulnerability doesn’t necessarily mean that it is 
not possible to apply an  EM condition as it may be appropriate to use a non -fitted 
device rather than a fitted device.  See Vulnerability considerations . 
 
For further information see Use of EM . 
 
The general expectation is that a person who poses a greater risk of harm and has 
been less compliant with immigration bail will remain on EM longer than a compliant 
person who poses a lower risk of harm. These considerations will also impact on 
how appropriate it is to use a non -fitted device where the person poses a high risk of 
harm or has been non -compliant with their bail conditions.  A person’s failure to 
comply with the conditions attached to a fitted device may be considered an 
indication of the like lihood of non -compliance with conditions attached to a  non-fitted 
device . The risk of harm posed by that person will influence the degree of tolera nce 
that will be had to such potential non -compliance.  This expectation is subject to 
practicality considerations as the available resources are applied to those who pose 
a greater risk to the public and/or of absconding over an extended period. Should 
there be no issue in regarding the availability of resourc e (that is,  available devices 
and the necessary resour ce to monitor them) decisions will be made on Convention 
Rights grounds or on the basis that it is impractical to do so given the person’s 
individual circumstances (as detailed further in paragraph 2 (9) of Part 1 of Schedule 
10 to the Immigration Act 2016 ). 
 
Any decision maker who wishes to propose a  variation to  EM, the EM device  or a 
supplementary condition must seek at least HEO agreement for this variation.  
 
The outcome of the review of EM and of any supplementary condition or conditions, 
including the consideration undertaken by the decision maker and any escalation to 
HEO or higher, should be recorded in a comprehensive file minute and on Atlas.  
 
Where immigration bail is managed by the First -tier Tribunal the Secretary of State 
may request that the EM condition is ceased if practicality issues now apply or 
Convention rights are disproportionately breached. Schedule 10 requires that the 
First-tier Tribunal acts in accordance with the Secretary of State’s decision where the 
duty applies. Where the monitored person, subject to the duty, applies direct to the 
Tribunal for a variation of bail to cease their EM condition, the Secretary of State 
must agre e that the duty no longer applies before it is ceased.  It will not be 
necessary to seek the First -tier Tribunal’s approval to move the person between 
device types.  
 
Decision makers are reminded of the need to employ professional curiosity when 
making any decision. Where there are concerns regarding the decision to be made 
advice should be sought from a Senior Caseworker in the first instance in line with 
the ethical d ecision model.  Page 48 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
  
Whilst EM Reviews provide the opportunity to consider whether the use of EM is  or 
remains appropriate , they do not provide a linear progression in all cases. It is 
possible that EM may not be appropriate for a period of time even where the EM 
duty would otherwise apply but a change of circumstances may make it appropriate 
at a later date . It may be possible to move a person between device types where 
there are changes in a person’s vulnerability or their compliance with their bail 
conditions.  
 
Decisions to remove a person from EM , where the duty applies,  will be based either 
on the basis that there is a breach of a person’s Convention Rights or on practicality 
grounds.  
 
Decision makers must consider:  
 
• the need for continued monitoring  
• whether the device type continues to be appropriate  
• the continued necessity of the supplementary condition or conditions – whether 
each supplementary condition  is still necessary or if the circumstances changed 
sufficiently that each supplementary condition no longer serves its intended 
purpose  
• the proportionality of the supplementary condition – whether the current 
restrictions imposed by that condition are still appropriate as follows:  
o curfews - both in terms of timing and length, whether there is a basis on 
which to alter the curfew, for example if family circumstances have changed 
significantly or they have been transferred from a radio frequency device to a 
GPS device  
o inclusion or exclusion zones – in terms of the location, size and number of 
zones, for example does the reason for setting the zone still apply  
• any challenge to the supplementary conditions or conditions – whether there 
has been a challenge to the supplementary condition or conditions from the 
individual or legal representatives, whether an argument has been made and 
how strong this is  
 
Where there is a proposal to add  or vary  any existing conditions the decision maker 
must give the person an opportunity to make representations about a supplementary 
condition before the supplementary condition is put in place as set out in 
Representations . 
 
Where the duty applies, and the decision maker wishes to propose that EM is 
ceased they must seek at least SEO authorisation.  
 
Where a review is prompted by a breach of EM conditions the individual must be 
invited to submit an explanation for that breach by service of a BAIL 204 and should 
be allowed 10 days to submit their response. Consideration of the response to 
breach should not take place until after those 10 days have expired unless the 
breach has effectively severed contact between the individual and the Home Office 
such as they have removed the device or otherwise stopped it from communicating 
with the monitoring system. I n those circumstances, consideration of the response to 
the breach may continue without delay.  Page 49 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
  
Use of automated business rules  
 
Where the EM duty applies, the decision maker may have access to a decision 
support tool which utilises automated business rules to provide decision 
recommendations  for the decision maker to consider alongside the guidance set out 
in Use of EM  and EM and linked supplementary conditions: Review . The decision 
support tool may make recommendations in the following areas:  
 
• whether a non -detained person is suitable for electronic monitoring  
• whether it is appropriate to consider moving  an electronically monitored person 
between a fitted device , a non -fitted device  and no device  
 
Key structured data that the tool utilises to generate its decision recommendations 
include:  
 
• a person’s age – are they 18 or over  
• are they identified as a mentally disordered offend er as defined in Immigration 
bail conditions: electronic monitoring (EM) duty  
• the overall time spent on EM (where that EM was imposed by the Home Office)  
• compliance with immigration bail  
• the risk of harm posed to the public  
 
Immigration legislation requires that decisions are made by a person. A decision 
support tool can make a recommendation which may be used by the decision maker 
as a starting point. However, consideration must be separately given to any known 
vulnerabilitie s, likelihood of failing to comply with bail, likelihood of re -offending and 
any additional factors known to the Home Office which may have an impact on the 
decision. The decision maker must them make a final recommendation for approval 
as set out in EM and linked Supplementary Conditions: review  
 
Whilst the decision support tool may be used to support decision making a decision 
may be made without using this tool and relying on the guidance set out in EM and 
linked Supplementary Conditions : review . 
 
Risk of harm types  - Offences  
 
The data that automated business rules uses when considering risk of harm is based 
on criminal offences set out in the table below. If a manual review is completed the 
same risk of harm should be applied when considering whether the use of EM 
remains proportionate.

Length of time on device type  
 
It is expected that a person who will be subject to EM will spend a minimum period 
on both a fitted and non -fitted device , unless it is indicated  during a review at an 
earlier point that there is a Convention reason why EM is no longer suitable . This  
minimum period  is determined by the tier the person falls into based on their 
offending history, which is proportionate to the risk of harm posed by the person. The 
harm score relates to the offence committed which may not automatically be 
reflected by the sent ence imposed. However, this is an expectation only and these 
are purely indicative thresholds; the time spent on both or either device type may 
vary from that indicated in the table below, as it will be based on circumstances, 
including compliance with bai l conditions, as well as the availability of devices:

and indefinitely  on non -
fitted device  
2 Greater than or equal to 400 6 years  12 months on fitted device 
and 30 months on non -
fitted device  Page 54 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024

4 Greater than or equal to 150 3 years  8 months on fitted device 
and 16 months on non -
fitted device  
5 Less than 150 Less than  3 
years  4 months on fitted device 
and 16 months on non -
fitted device  
 
Where the monitored person has no criminal convictions, the decision will be based 
on the remaining factors and will be considered to fall into tier 5.  
 
Use of data  
 
The GPS device collects trail data that is a record of where a person was over a 
period which can be displayed either in a list showing the date, time and location 
points at which data was collected or as a trail of timestamped dots on a map.  
 
The data collected is processed by the EM Supplier on behalf of the Home Office 
and is not immediately accessible by the Home Office. The EM Supplier will notify 
the Home Office of any breaches of EM related immigration bail conditions, for 
example failure  to charge a device or failing to respond to a biometric request. In 
addition, where appropriate, data can be requested from the EM Supplier. Use of the 
data collected is subject to the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and 
a Data Protection Imp act Assessment (DPIA). The DPIA specifies the instances 
when data may be accessed which are  as follows.  
 
Breach of Immigration Bail Conditions  
 
In the event of a notification of a qualified breach of Immigration Bail conditions from 
the supplier, authorised Home Office Staff may perform a full review of the bail 
conditions and ask the individual wearer for any mitigation for the breach. The review  
consideration may be informed by the mitigation supplied and the review of the full 
trail monitoring data records where proportionate and justified.  
 
If, during the review of the trail data, it becomes apparent that further breaches of 
immigration bail conditions may have been/ are being committed ( for example,  trail 
data provides a strong indication that the person is working in breach – showing 
them at a specific location other than home between 8:00 am – 5:00pm hours) then 
that data may be shared within the Home Office , for example,  Immigration 
Intelligence where it is proportionate and justified to investigate for further possible 
immigration breaches  under Part 2 of the DPA 2018.  
 Page 55 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 If, during the review of the trail data by the Home Office, there is any other indication 
that criminal activity is or has taken place, then that data may be processed and

Immigration bail conditions: other  
 
Under paragraph 2(1)(f) of Schedule 10, a person may be subject to ‘such other 
conditions as the person granting the immigration bail thinks fit’.  
 
Any such condition must be reasonable , and it must be necessary to meet the 
purpose of the grant of the immigration bail. For example, decision makers may 
require a person granted immigration bail to notify the Home Office of a change of 
circumstances , a change of address  or require them to surrender their passport if Page 56 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 there is reason to believe that the person might deface or destroy the document to 
obstruct return to the country of origin or country from which the person arrived.  
 
Where the person is also subject to a release licence it will not be appropriate to 
repeat conditions within their immigration bail conditions where to do so presents 
conflict in managing any breach of those conditions. It may be appropriate to require 
compliance with a release licence (whilst valid) in more general terms just as an 
offender manager may require general compliance with immigration bail.  
 
Curfews may be used to mitigate risk to the public if the person being granted bail 
poses such a risk (and such risk is not being managed by an offender manager). The 
length of the curfew and time of day to which it applies must be determined on the 
facts of the individual case and must be proportionate.  
 
Inclusion or Exclusion  zones may be used to mitigate risk to the public if the person 
being granted bail poses such a risk  (and such risk is not being managed by an 
offender manager).  The extent of the inclusion/exclusion zone must be determined 
on the facts of the individual case and must be proportionate.  
 
Immigration bail supplementary conditions: curfews, inclusion 
or exclusion zones  
 
Decision makers must always consider the use of EM when granting immigration bail 
to a person who is subject to the duty. Additionally, decision makers may request 
EM where the person presents a high risk of absconding from immigration bail or 
they pose a significant risk of harm to the public or to public health. Decision makers 
may also request additional supplementary conditions if the facts of the case warrant 
it. For practical reasons supplementary conditions should only be applied to a fitted 
device.  
 
Supplementary conditions should only be applied in extreme cases and any reliance 
on the scoring of risk of harm or re -offending must be taken from the assessment 
made by an Offender Manager - it should not be one made by a Home Office case 
owner.  
 
Where a person is subject to the duty the authority of an HEO  must be obtained to 
request EM and any supplementary condition must be authorised by an  SEO.  
 
The authority of a  Deputy  Director  must be obtained before requesting EM and/or a 
supplementary condition where the person is not subject to the duty.  
 
GPS EM can operate effectively without the use of a curfew or an inclusion/exclusion 
zone. The use of these conditions is rightly subject to scrutiny by the Courts and are 
considered to be akin to detention. As a result,  they should only be considered 
where there is a clear demonstrable link to the effective management of immigration 
bail. They should not be used where a similar condition is set by an offender 
manager or to extend expired licence conditions. Prevention of  further offending is 
unlikely to be  a significant reason on its own.  
 Page 57 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 In every request, decision makers must clearly identify and fully describe the risk of 
harm and/or risk of re -offending or absconding posed by the FNO. The decision 
maker’s consideration process must demonstrate why a supplementary condition is 
necessary i n the particular circumstances of the case. If the decision maker is 
requesting one or more supplementary conditions, the justification for each must be 
set out separately and include:  
 
• the intended aim of the named supplementary condition  or conditions  
• the risks of not applying the named supplementary condition  or conditions  
• what the named supplementary condition  or conditions  can achieve that cannot 
be realised by other immigration bail conditions  
 
In cases identified as suitable for a curfew, inclusion or exclusion zone conditions, 
the decision maker must, in the bail summary (BAIL 505) or referral for Secretary of 
State bail (BAIL 407) do the following:  
 
• request an EM immigration bail condition and additionally for curfews state 
clearly the curfew period or periods sought setting out the reasons for 
requesting the curfew, and the requested length and timing (its aim and the 
risks if curfew is not imposed)  
• for inclusion or exclusion zones, state clearly the reason for requesting it, the 
inclusion or exclusion zone required using available mapping tools supported 
by a description of the affected zones (its aim and risks if not imposed)  - it must 
also clearly state the periods that the zone will be in operation for, including 
where that is 24 hours every day  
 
For example, if a decision maker requests a curfew and the aim of the curfew is to 
reduce the risk of re -offending, there must be a logical connection between the 
length and timing of the requested curfew period or periods and the previous 
offending pattern. Another example could be demonstrating how the particular 
location and size of an inclusion or exclusion zones would reduce the risk of harm.  
 
In all cases the decision maker must be able to justify the use of the supplementary 
condition in relation to the risk of harm, reoffending and/or absconding and/or the 
previous offending pattern.  
 
It will then be the decision of the First -tier Tribunal or Strategic Director, as 
appropriate, to determine if the requested supplementary condition or conditions are 
proportionate and justifiable. If it is concluded that the requested supplementary 
condit ions are not proportionate or justifiable in the circumstances of the case, the 
request will be refused.  
 
Where the decision is made by the Strategic Director the decision maker must give 
the person to be granted bail an opportunity to make representations about a 
supplementary condition before the supplementary condition is put in place as set 
out in Represen tations above. Where the decision maker is the first -tier Tribunal the 
person or their representative may make their representations during the bail 
hearing.

 Linked Supplementary Conditions : review  
 
See also: Varying immigration bail conditions . 
 
Where supplementary  conditions linked to EM have been used, such as curfews, 
inclusion zones or exclusion zones, regular monitoring is required to ensure that they 
remain necessary and proportionate. See EM and linked Supplementary Conditions: 
review.  
 
Where there is a proposal to add  / extend any existing conditions the decision maker 
must give the person to be granted bail an opportunity to make representations 
about a supplementary condition before the supplementary condition is put in place 
as set out in Representations . 
 
Immigration bail conditions: financial condition  
 
As mentioned under Immigration bail conditions: general , a financial condition may 
be attached to a ll grant s of immigration bail. A financial condition is a condition that 
requires the person granted bail, or another named person (Financial Condition 
Supporter), to pay a sum of money (payment liability) if the person granted bail fails 
to comply with one or more  of the other condition or conditions attached to the grant 
of immigration bail. A financial condition cannot be imposed in isolation . It may 
be imposed only if it is thought to be an appropriate means of ensuring that the 
bailed person complies w ith at least one of the other conditions of immigration bail. 
For example, a financial condition of £500 for failing to comply with a reporting 
condition plus a sum of £500 for failing to comply with a condition relating to work.  
 
You must obtain  higher executive officer ( HEO ) authorisation if setting or varying a 
financial condition. Currently only the Foreign National Offender Returns Command 
(FNO RC) and the relevant unit will be imposing financial conditions. However, if the 
First-tier Tribunal has set this condition and transferred management of the bail to 
the Secretary of State, any team can continue to manage this condition.  
 
Official – sensitive: start of section  
 
The information on this page has been removed as it is restricted for internal Home 
Office use.  
 
 
Official – sensitive: end of section  
 
You must specify the following when imposing a financial condition:  
 
• the sum of money required to be paid (payment liability)  
• when the sum of money is to be paid  
• the form and manner in which it is to be paid  
 
The use of a financial condition to secure compliance with other conditions of 
immigration bail is flexible. It may be a single sum imposed against one or more Page 59 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 individual condition s so that the specified sum of money becomes payable if that 
particular condition is breached, or it may be different sums imposed against 
different conditions.  
 
Financial condition: fixing the sum to be paid  
 
You must view the sum of money to be paid as part of a financial condition in relation 
to the means of the person to be bailed or the Financial Condition Supporter. You 
must set payment liability at a level that will act as a substantial incentive to the 
person to comply with the relevant other condition or conditions of immigration bail.  
 
You must assess each case on its own merits.  
 
You should not normally apply a financial condition in a sum less than £500 to a bail 
condition. This is because, if this went to debt recovery, the recovery itself would 
cost more money than the actual debt.  A Financial Condition Supporter (see below) 
is however required to support all the conditions which have been set when bail is 
granted by an Immigration Judge, and in case of Secretary of State bail this will 
apply only to the conditions set on the specific Bail 301 SoS form  
 
Financial Condition Supporter  (FCS)  
 
During a person’s  induction into immigration detention, a n official  acting on behalf of 
the Secretary of State will provide a pack which includes the relevant bail notices 
and a factsheet about how the FCS process works, in the event of being granted  
bail. For further information see Informing detainees of their immigration bail rights . 
 
A Financial Condition Supporter must satisfy all of the following:  
 
• be aged over 18 and settled in the UK with indefinite leave to remain (a person 
on immigration bail or with limited leave will not be acceptable as that person’s 
own stay may be limited/curtailed)  
• have a personal connection with the person, or be acting on behalf of a 
reputable organisation which has an interest in the person’s welfare  
• have enough money or disposable assets (clear of existing liabilities) to be able 
to pay the sum due if the person breaches a relevant immigration bail condition  
• be a homeowner or at least well -established in the place of residence  
• be free of any unspent criminal convictions (see Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 
guidance ) – but see the note following these bullet points on unspent 
convictions  
• not to have come to adverse notice in connection with other immigration 
matters, including, in particular, previous immigration bail cases

Unspent convictions : a Financial Condition Supporter with an unspent conviction 
may still be suitable – the gravity with which a particular offence is viewed, and the 
consequences for the suitability of the Financial Condition Supporter, will be a matter 
for the discretion of t he Secretary of State  or Immigration Judge . 
 
Investigating Financial Condition Supporters  
 
The financial and general standing of all prospective Financial Condition Supporters 
should be investigated as fully as possible. The decision maker must give them a 
BAIL 306 notice setting out what is required when standing as a Financial Condition 
Suppor ter. As such, they will be asked to produce evidence of their identity and 
financial position. Care should be taken over accepting bank books, statements of 
account  and other similar evidence  at face value , as it may be that sums of money 
have been deposit ed temporarily to create a false picture of the holder's means. A 
record of deposits over a period (minimum of 3 months) is a useful indication of 
financial status.  
 
All the usual immigration checks  must be undertaken.  
 Page 61 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 Immigration Intelligence may be consulted in appropriate cases (for example, where 
it is suspected that a Financial Condition Supporter may previously have been 
involved in facilitation or racketeering activities).  
 
Where the Secretary of State is granting immigration bail, a Financial Condition 
Supporter will need to sign a BAIL 301 notice setting out the other condition  or 
conditions  of immigration bail to which the financial condition is attached. See: 
Immigration bail Consideration of bail process: detained: FNOs, with financial 
condition . 
 
Where the Tribunal is granting immigration bail, the Home Office decision maker 
must record information on the Financial Condition Supporter checks done and their 
outcome on the bail summary BAIL 505, including where no opportunity to conduct 
checks has be en given.  
 
Financial condition: recovery  
 
A payment liability under a financial condition is to be paid to the Secretary of State if  
either of  the following applies, the : 
 
• Secretary of State granted the immigration bail  
• First-tier Tribunal granted the immigration bail but has directed that the power 
to vary the person’s bail conditions is to be exercisable by the Secretary of 
State  
 
In all other cases, the payment liability is to be paid to the Tribunal.  
 
The person liable for payment must be given the opportunity to make 
representations regarding the alleged breach.  
 
For further information on financial recovery, see Recovery of payment under 
financial condition .

 Exercising the power to grant 
immigration bail  
 
This page tells you about using the power to grant immigration bail. It also tells you 
about limitations on using the power.  
 
In considering whether to grant immigration bail to a person, and which conditions to 
attach to the immigration bail if granted, the Secretary of State or the First -tier 
Tribunal must have regard to the following:  
 
• the likelihood of the person failing to comply with a bail condition  
• whether the person has been convicted of an offence (whether inside or outside 
the UK)  
• the likelihood of the person committing an offence while on immigration bail  
• the likelihood of the person’s presence in the UK while on immigration bail 
causing a danger to public health or being a threat to the maintenance of public 
order  
• whether the person’s detention is necessary in that person’s interest or for the 
protection of any other person (for example, if a person is awaiting transfer to a 
mental health hospital)  
• whether the person has failed without reasonable excuse to cooperate with any 
process:  
o for determining whether the person requires or should be granted leave to 
enter or remain in the United Kingdom  
o for determining the period for which the person should be granted such leave 
and any conditions to which it should be subject  
o for determining whether the person’s leave to enter or remain the United 
Kingdom should be varied, curtailed, suspended or cancelled  
o for determining whether the person should be removed from the United 
Kingdom  
o for removing the person from the United Kingdom  
• such other matters as the Secretary of State or the First -tier Tribunal consider 
relevant (for example, the Adults at Risk in immigration detention policy ) 
 
Statutory limitations on First -tier Tribunal power to grant 
immigration bail  
 
The power of the First -tier Tribunal to grant immigration bail is subject to the 
following statutory limitations:  
 
Detention under paragraph 16(1) of Schedule 2  
 
Under paragraph 3(3) of Schedule 10 to the Immigration Act 2016, the First -tier 
Tribunal must not grant bail to a person detained under paragraph 16(1) of Schedule 
2 to the Immigration Act 1971 until the end of a period of 8 days since the person 
arrived i n the UK. This means that the earliest point at which the First -tier Tribunal Page 63 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 can grant immigration bail to a person detained under paragraph 16(1) of Schedule 2 
to the Immigration Act 2016 is on day 9 of the person’s presence in the UK.  
 
This limitation only applies to people detained under paragraph 16(1) of Schedule 2. 
It does not extend to those detained under paragraph 16(1A) of the Schedule.  
 
Consent to bail: directions in force for removal within 21 days of 
bail decision  
 
See also: Consent to bail: Secretary of State . 
 
Under paragraph 3(4) of Schedule 10, the First -tier Tribunal must not grant bail to a 
person who is detained without the consent of the Secretary of State  if both of the 
following apply : 
 
• directions for the persons removal from the UK are in force (and are not 
withdrawn)  
• the directions require the person to be removed from the UK within 21 days, 
starting with the date of the decision on whether the person should be granted 
immigration bail  
 
This means that, if the Presenting Officer provides evidence that removal directions 
are set for 21 days or fewer away at a bail hearing, the First -tier Tribunal cannot 
grant immigration bail if the Secretary of State does not consent.  
 
Under paragraphs 8 -10A or 12 -14 of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 
directions for removal are given to the carrier by which the person is to be removed. 
This includes removal by way of charter flights. Removal can only take place if 
directions are p roperly given in accordance with these paragraphs.  
 
For these purposes, evidence of directions for removal being in force can be 
demonstrated when any of the following has been served on the person and/or the 
carrier that is required to conduct the removal:  
 
• Notice of Departure Details    
• IS 83 (directions to remove individual issued to the carrier in port cases)  
• IS 152B (directions to remove individual issued to the carrier in non -port cases)  
 
• flight manifest (directions given to the carrier for a charter flight)  
 
See Enforced removals: notice periods . 
 
Repeat applications for immigration bail  
 
Paragraph 12(2) of Schedule 10 requires Tribunal Procedure Rules to secure that if 
the First -tier Tribunal has decided not to grant a person immigration bail, the Tribunal 
must dismiss any further application for the person to be granted immigration bail 
without a hearing if  both of the following apply : Page 64 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
  
• the application is made within 28 days of the earlier decision  
• the person does not, on the papers, demonstrate to the Tribunal that there has 
been a material change in the person’s circumstances

 Informing detained persons of their 
immigration bail rights  
 
With immediate effect and until further notice, the use of Informing detained persons 
of their immigration bail rights as set out in this instruction is suspended and the 
separate  Immigration bail interim guidance  must be used instead.  
 
This page tells you about making detained persons aware of their bail rights, 
including the documents that must be given to them and when they must be given.  
 
Information on immigration bail rights is contained in the reasons for detention form 
(IS91R or equivalent) issued to every person on detention.  
 
The information in the form must be explained to the person, using an interpreter if 
necessary. Information on immigration bail rights is also included in the monthly 
progress update to detained persons (IS151F or equivalent).  
 
Detained persons must also be given BAIL 403 during their induction to detention. 
This contains information on:  
 
• when they can apply for immigration bail  
• how to make immigration bail applications to the Secretary of State (using form 
BAIL 401)  
• how to make immigration bail applications to the First -tier Tribunal (using form

 Immigration bail: Secretary of State  
 
The page tells you about the Secretary of State immigration bail process.  
 
The Secretary of State may consider for a grant of immigration bail a person who is 
detained – or who is liable to be detained – under one of the provisions mentioned 
under Eligibility for bail . The consideration may take place whether or not the person 
has submitted an application for immigration bail.  
 
In the following circumstances, the relevant team can decide to grant bail without an 
application form, when:  
 
• a person is first encountered at a port or elsewhere in the UK , Border Force 
officers must complete an Immigration Bail Risk Assessment form  as part of 
this process, see Immigration Bail Process Map  
• a person is detained and a casework team proactively decides that detention is 
no longer appropriate  
• Foreign National Offender Returns Command  decides not to detain a Foreign 
National Offender (FNO) for deportation action at the end of criminal sentence  
 
Application for bail  
 
Detained persons must submit their applications for Secretary of State immigration 
bail using form BAIL 401. This form is available on GOV.UK If the decision maker 
receives an application in another format, it may be rejected , and a BAIL 405 notice 
sent directing the person to the correct form.  
 
The decision -making unit must log all applications for Secretary of State bail on 
Atlas. When doing this:  
 
• for NRC cases ‘date applied’ is when the Customer Liaison Team (CLT) 
receives the application  
• in all other cases the ‘date applied’ must be the date the decision -making unit 
received the application  
 
Decision makers must make their decisions and send a response to the applicant 
within 10 working days of the date recorded under ‘date applied’.  
 
Level of authority to grant or refuse immigration bail  
 
The minimum level of authority to grant, or refuse following application, immigration 
bail to detained individuals on behalf of the Secretary of State is HEO  / CIO / HO 
level.  
 
Time served foreign national offenders  may generally only be granted bail if  agreed 
at Assistant Director level, and  Strategic Director  authorisation has been obtained. 
However, bail may be granted with authorisation at SEO  / Inspector  / SO level if all of 
the following apply:  Page 68 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
  
• the individual was detained to take part in an interview scheme with their 
embassy or high commission  
• the individual complies with that interview or the interview is cancelled and not 
re-scheduled in the short term  
• the individual has previously been compliant with reporting and/or other 
conditions of immigration bail  
• there is no short -term prospect of returning the individual following the interview  
• grant of bail is within 7 days of the individual being detained for the interview 
scheme  
 
Individuals managed by the relevant unit (see below) may only be granted bail if 
grade 5 authorisation is obtained.

Immigration bail consideration process: detained  
 
See also:  
 
• Level of authority to grant or refuse immigration bail  
• Conditions of Immigration Bail  
 
If the person you are considering for a grant of immigration bail is detained, you must 
take into account both the requirements set out under exercising the power to grant 
immigration bail  and, in addition, the following:  
 
• the length of any likely additional period necessary to eliminate barriers to 
removal  
• any specific features of the case  – such as those set out below  – which indicate 
that detention is necessary  
• the reliability and standing of any Financial Condition Supporters  
• where appropriate, whether the person has a suitable settled address  
• any other factors relevant to the decision to detain  Page 69 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 • in Foreign National Offender Returns Command cases, any licence conditions  
 
Indicators that a person is unlikely to comply with the conditions of immigration bail 
might include:  
 
• any history of escaping, or attempting to escape, from legal custody  
• previous breach or breaches of conditions of immigration bail  – or its 
predecessors  
• statement from the person or the person’s Financial Condition Supporter 
indicating an intention to breach bail  
• the person’s immigration application sponsor, if any, refusing to act as Financial 
Condition Supporter because the sponsor does not believe the person will 
comply, even if other Financial Condition Supporters are produced 
subsequently  
• risk of offending or potential harm to the public, including on the basis of 
national security, terrorism, criminality  
• previous failed removal attempt owing to the individual’s disruptive behaviour or 
failure to comply with the documentation process  
 
The above lists are not exhaustive. You must assess each case on its individual 
merits, taking account of the person’s family, social and economic background, 
health (physical and mental) and immigration history. You may still be able to grant 
immigration bail to a person with an adverse background or history if they produce 
sufficient and satisfactory Financial Condition Supporters or there are reasons to 
believe that the person will comply with bail conditions.  
 
Where a person has no fixed abode to reside at whilst on bail, this is not a barrier to 
a grant of bail. However, it should be considered whether this increases a risk of 
non-compliance with bail conditions, the person committing an offence whilst on bail 
or other factors set out in Exercising the power to grant immigration bail . Where risks 
are identified, these will need to be balanced against whether other bail conditions 
can be imposed to reduce the risks.  
 
If an individual is detained, decision makers must complete either a Grant 
Consideration Form (BAIL 408) or for FNOs, Referral of Case Suitable for Secretary 
of State Bail (BAIL 407) when assessing a person for a grant of immigration bail.  
 
Immigration bail consideration process: detained: FNOs with 
financial condition  
 
If you are considering attaching a financial condition to one or more other conditions 
of granting bail to an FNO, the following should happen , if relevant:  
 
• if an application for Secretary of State bail (BAIL 401) is received, the FNO 
must provide details of possible Financial Conditions Supporters  
• if bail is being considered without an application from the detained person, the 
decision maker must ask the person for possible Financial Condition 
Supporters in the event of bail being granted  Page 70 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 • if bail is considered appropriate the decision maker must complete the BAIL 
407 proposing the grant of bail and set the appropriate financial condition(s) 
and refer for authorisation  
• if bail is authorised, fully or conditionally, the decision maker must conduct any 
necessary checks on the Financial Condition Supporters  – this must include 
any additional checks the authoriser may request with the intention to grant bail  
• the decision maker must send the BAIL 301 (Financial Condition Supporter 
Agreement) to the supporter by email giving 2 working days to sign and return :  
o if this timescale is unrealistic, for example if no email address is provided, it 
will be necessary to adjust it to allow for the BAIL 301 to be sent out and 
returned by post  
o decision makers may also allow Financial Condition Supporters more than 2 
working days to return BAIL 301s sent by email if considered necessary  
 
Outcome of consideration  
 
Following receipt of a person’s application for immigration bail, decision makers must 
decide whether immigration bail should be granted or refused. Decision makers must 
document the reasons for their decisions on Atlas  and/or the person’s case  / port file.  
 
Grant of immigration bail  
 
If the Secretary of State decides to grant immigration bail, the decision maker must 
notify the person in writing. The notice (BAIL 201) must include:  
 
• when the grant of immigration bail begins  
• the bail conditions  
 
Under paragraph 3(8) of Schedule 10, the start of a grant of immigration bail may be 
specified to be conditional on arrangements stipulated in the notice being in place to 
ensure that the person is able to comply with the bail conditions. This provision is 
likely to be most relevant in cases where a grant of immigration bail is subject to:  
 
• a residence condition – while arrangements are made to secure 
accommodation if it is not already available  
• an electronic monitoring condition – while arrangements are made to install the 
necessary equipment   
 
The bail conditions imposed must be in line with the requirements of conditions of 
immigration bail . Decisions on the appropriate conditions must be made on the facts 
of the individual case. Conditions must:  
 
• enable the Home Office to maintain appropriate levels of contact with the 
individual  
• reduce the risk of absconding or other non -compliance  
• minimise potential delay in the Home Office becoming aware of any non -
compliance  
• be in furtherance of facilitating the individual’s return  
 Page 71 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 In Foreign National Offender Returns Command cases, decision makers should 
consider any criminal licence conditions fully to ensure any immigration bail 
conditions do not conflict.  
 
If decision makers in detained and non -detained cases wish to set up reporting to 
facilitate detention on reporting (DOR) or a contact management regime when BAIL 
201 is served, then they must use the ICE Finder  to identify the appropriate reporting 
location and follow the instructions to set up the first reporting event.   
 
For some reporting centres, the details of the first reporting event will be stipulated 
and decision makers can simply follow the instructions.  
 
For other reporting centres, decision makers will need to contact the reporting centre 
directly. The reporting centre will then review and set up any further reporting events.  
 
The exception to this is Foreign National Offender Returns Command  or relevant unit 
(see below) cases and those required to report to a police station. Decision makers 
must communicate with the appropriate reporting centre in such cases.  
 
See Reporting and Offender Management  for further details on communication 
between decision makers and reporting centres.

Issuing bail paperwork  
 
If a decision was taken to detain the individual but the Detention Gatekeeper rejects 
it, the referring officer is responsible for issuing the bail paperwork. If the Gatekeeper 
has accepted the individual in detention but at the 24 -hour review stage decides to 
release them, then the Gatekeeper is responsible for issuing the bail paperwork.  
 
The decision maker responsible for issuing the bail paperwork must prepare and 
issue the following documents to implement the decision:  
 
• if not already done, issue relevant notice containing liability to  removal  / 
detention wording (for example,  the Notice of Liability to Remove (NOL) , IS.81 . 
• Grant  / Variation of Immigration Bail (BAIL 201) , although business areas using 
any of the following documents do not need to serve a separate BAIL 201 
notice unless they are varying existing conditions:  
o ICD.3971B IA (email or post)  
o ICD.3971D IA (email or post)  
o ICD.2704  
o ICD.1183  IA 
o ICD.3052  IA Page 72 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 o ICD.3912  
o ARN.0001  
o ARN.0002  
o ARN.0003  
o ARN .0004  
o ARN.0005  
 
The following f urther notices may need to be issued depending on the arrangements 
being made:  
 
• Notice to Carrier of Self Check -In Arrangements  (BAIL 202(SCI)) , if applicable  
• Financial Condition Supporter Agreement to Immigration Bail Financial 
Condition  (BAIL 301) , if applicable   
• Notice to Police of Immigration Bail Reporting Condition  (BAIL 205) , if 
applicable  
• Notice to Electronic Monitoring Contractor  (BAIL 206) , if applicable  
• Release Order (IS.106) to IRC or prison, if the person is detained  
 
If a grant of immigration bail is subject to a financial condition, the person being 
granted the bail and the Financial Condition Supporter, if applicable, must sign the 
Grant/Variation of Bail document (BAIL 201) and Financial Condition Supporter 
Agreement to Financial condition (BAIL 301), respectively. The decision maker must 
make copies of the signed documents and place these on the bailed person’s port or 
case file.  
 
Updating  Atlas  
 
All decision s to grant bail  must be recorded on Atlas , including t he date the decision 
was made.  
 
Notifying interested parties  
 
If a detained person is granted immigration bail, the decision maker must notify the 
following interested parties:  
 
• Detention Gatekeeper  
• detainee escorting and population management unit (DEPMU)  
• place of detention, to arrange release  
• relevant casework unit managing non -detained cases  
• electronic monitoring contractor (if electronic monitoring is imposed)  
• offender manager (if a FNO RC  case)  
• relevant reporting centre  / police station (if the person is required to report to 
the police)  
• local police (if they have an interest, for example, if releasing a high -risk person 
into their area)  
 
Refusal of immigration bail  
 Page 73 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 If the Secretary of State refuses to grant immigration bail, the decision maker must 
notify the person using form BAIL 402 (refusal of Secretary of State Bail Application)  
and record it on the person’s detention and case progression review form. Any 
decision to refuse must be authorised at minimum HEO level.  
 
Decision makers must use paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 10 as a non -exhaustive 
checklist for structuring the decision -making process. This structured approach must 
be reflected on Atlas , which must be updated to set out the reasons for refusing bail 
in line with the Consideration Process . In the interests of consistency, decision 
makers should use the following wording when  recording the reasons on Atlas : 
 
‘The presumption is in favour of immigration bail and I have considered all of the 
matters stipulated in paragraph 3(2) and consider the following applicable in this 
case…. ’ 
 
This wording must not be used without including the reasons why bail has been 
refused.  
 
The decision maker must update Atlas to record the outcome as ‘refused’ , includ ing 
the date of refusal.  
 
Repeat immigration bail applications  
 
There is no limit on the number applications for immigration bail a person can make 
to the Secretary of State, or when an application can be made. Where a repeat 
application has been made but there has been no change in the person’s 
circumstances, a bail a pplication may be refused by cross -referring to the same 
reasons as the previous application.

 Immigration bail: First -tier Tribunal  
 
This page tells you about the First -tier Tribunal immigration bail process.  
 
A person who is detained under one of the provisions listed under Eligibility for 
immigration bail  can apply to the First -tier Tribunal for a grant of immigration bail. 
The First -tier Tribunal is independent of the Home Office. This means that while the 
Home Office can oppose bail and/or propose conditions to be attached to a grant of 
immigration bail,  the First -tier Tribunal is not obliged to follow the Home Office’s 
wishes.  
 
The Tribunal Procedure (First -tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) 
Rules 2014  (SI 2604/2014) govern the procedures to be followed in relation to bail 
applications to a judge of the First -tier Tribunal.  
 
The application form for First -tier Tribunal bail (B1) is given to detained persons at 
the point of initial detention. To make an application, the  person , or their 
representative, sends the completed form to the First -tier Tribunal directly. The role 
of the Home Office in First -tier Tribunal bail is to respond to the bail application by:  
 
• producing a bail summary (BAIL 505) to justify the Home Office’s case for 
detaining the individual and the reason(s) why bail should be refused, or what 
conditions would be considered appropriate should bail be granted  
• being represented by a Presenting Officer (PO) at the bail hearing  
 
The Home Office also has a duty to refer certain cases to the Tribunal automatically 
for consideration . 
 
The Tribunal Procedure Rules require applications for immigration bail to be subject 
to a hearing. The exception is if a person’s bail application had been refused 
following a hearing in the preceding 28 days and there has been no material change 
in the pe rson’s circumstances.  
 
Consideration of cases  
 
Listing an immigration bail hearing  
 
Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) is responsible for listing bail 
hearings , and this is, where possible, done within 3 working days of receiving a bail 
application. HMCTS must provide the ALAR Bail Team  with copies of bail 
applications as soon as reasonably practicable following receipt.  
 
The format of bail hearings may vary according to the preference of the presiding 
judge , but a typical hearing will be as follows:  
 
• the detained person or their representative first presents the case for bail  
• the Home Office Presenting Officer (PO) responds, putting forward reasons for 
opposing bail as outlined in the BAIL 505 bail summary  – the PO will also put Page 75 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 forward any new information  or update s since the BAIL 505 was written,  such 
as a removal date  
• the person or their representative then has the opportunity to argue against the 
points made in the bail summary  
• if there is a Financial Condition Supporter (FCS) present they may be asked 
questions by the representative (or detained person) .  
• the PO may be given the opportunity to cross -examine the FCS  (but this is not 
routine)   
• both parties then have the final opportunity to deliver submissions  on the 
suitability of the FCS  
• the judge is able to ask any questions deemed necessary at any stage  once 
submissions are completed, the judge will decide whether or not to grant bail  
 
Detained persons will normally attend their bail hearings via video link. On rare 
occasions, where there is a practical reason why it is not possible or suitable for the 
hearing to take place via video link the Tribunal will ask the SSHD to arrange for the 
detained person to attend in person.  
 
While it is not mandatory for Financial Condition Supporters to attend the bail 
hearing, the expectation is that they will attend , and absence may well undermine 
the chances of a successful outcome for the person.  
 
- 
 
All parties are expected to provide any documentary evidence they intend to rely on 
in advance of the bail hearing , either as part of the bail application or with the signed 
BAIL 301 . For example, Financial Condition Supporters must supply proof of identity 
and immigration status , bank statements and proof that they can accommodate the 
person  so that appropriate checks can be conducted. Failure to provide this 
evidence in advance of the hearing will result in the Immigration Judge being told th e 
FCS is unsu itable .   
 
Bail summary  
 
The bail summary should set out the reasons for opposing bail (if bail is to be 
opposed), and any conditions that would be considered necessary were the First -tier 
Tribunal to grant bail. A First -tier Tribunal judge will grant immigration bail where 
there is no sufficiently good reason to detain a person and where lesser measures 
can provide adequate alternative means of control. In deciding whether to grant 
immigration bail, a First -tier Tribunal judge must have regard to the requirements set 
out under exercising the power to grant immigration bail . In particular the IJ will have 
regard to whether the person will be removed within a reasonable timescale. It is 
therefore important to set out in the bail summary the measures taken to progress 
the case towards removal and any progress since the last bail hearing  (if 
appropriate).  
 
A judge may also focus on:  
 
• reason or reasons why the person has been detained  Page 76 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 • length of detention to date and likely future duration  
 
Additional information on what factors First -tier Tribunal judges normally consider in 
reaching a decision on bail applications is available in the related link:  Guidance on 
Immigration Bail for Judges of the First -tier Tribunal  (Immigration and Asylum 
Chamber).   
 
When staff in the ALAR Bail Team  are notified of an application for immigration bail 
to the First -tier Tribunal they will request a bail summary from the decision maker. 
They do this by sending the decision maker:  
 
• a form requesting a bail summary  
• the bail application  
• any supporting documents  
 
On receiving the request, the BAIL 301 (FTT) must be sent to the Financial Condition 
Supporter for completion as a  matter of urgency and by email if possible. The 
decision maker should  ensure they conduct all the required checks on any Financial 
Condition Supporters  included in the bail application and complete the bail summary 
template (BAIL 505) accurately and in full setting out the reasons why the bail 
application is being opposed by the Home Office.  
 
Bail summaries must be full, fair and accurate. The decision maker completing the 
bail summary must ensure that all relevant issues are covered in the bail summary 
and must also include:  
 
• the detained person's personal details  
• details of the Financial Condition Supporters the person has put forward, if any  
and the result of any checks . 
• a full immigration history and chronology  
• the reasons for opposing bail  
• whether removal directions are set for the person to be removed from the UK 
within 21 days of the bail hearing   
• date of last hearing at which bail was refused, if any and actions taken since 
the last hearing to resolve  the barriers  to removal   
• the conditions the Home Office wishes to be set in the event that bail is granted  
• an as sessment of whether the person would meet the exceptional criteria  for 
provision of accommodation if bail is granted   
• a request for the Tribunal to direct management of bail to be transferred to the 
Secretary of State  
 
When completing the bail summary, the decision maker must update any Financial 
Condition Supporter details on  Atlas . 
 
The fully completed bail summary must be returned to the ALAR Bail Team  in time 
for it to be filed with the First -tier Tribunal by 2pm on the day before the hearing at 
the latest. In practice, this means sending it to the ALAR Bail Team  no later than 12 
noon on the day before the hearing.  
 Page 77 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 If the ALAR Bail Team  is unable to file the bail summary with the First -tier Tribunal 
by the deadline because it was notified of the bail application fewer than 24 hours 
before the hearing, the bail summary must be filed as soon as is reasonably 
practicable. In addition to fili ng the bail summary with the First -tier Tribunal, the 
ALAR Bail Team  must also, by 2pm on the day before the hearing, send the bail 
summary to  
 
• the detained person at their place of the detention  
• the detained person’s representative , if any  
 
Bail summary: additional requirements if removal scheduled within 
21 days of hearing  
 
If directions are in force for the removal of the detained person from the UK within 21 
days of the bail hearing, then the decision maker must include the following 
additional information in the bail summary:  
 
• details of notice of removal – includes notice of a removal window, notice of 
removal directions or limited notice of removal, as appropriate – see Returns 
management  for guidance on the different notices of removal  
• the contact details of the primary and secondary contact SCS, acting on behalf 
of the Secretary of State in respect of consent (see Consent to bail: Secretary 
of State  below), to provide instructions to the Presenting Officer if the judge of 
the First -tier Tribunal intends to grant immigration bail . For this reason, it is 
important that the primary and secondary contacts are made aware in advance 
of the date and time of the hearing.  
• evidence  of directions for removal being in force  
 
Directions for removal within 21 days: evidence  
 
See also: Consent to bail: directions in force for removal within 21 days of bail 
decision . 
 
One of the following must be submitted with the bail summary in these cases as 
evidence of removal directions having been set for the person’s removal within 21 
days:  
 
• if the individual has been notified of the full details of their removal , a copy of 
the Notice of Departure Details or IS152B as appropriate   
• if the individual is being removed on a chartered flight , a copy of the charter 
manifest  – redacting information on other individuals  – may be used  
 
Removal directions set after bail summary completed  
 
If removal directions are set for within 21 days of the bail hearing after the bail 
summary has already been completed and sent to the ALAR Bail Team , the decision 
maker must notify the ALAR Bail Team  without delay.  
 Page 78 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 Bail summary: requirements for auto -referrals  
 
The decision maker must complete a bail summary (BAIL 505) for all eligible 
detained persons who have not opted out of the automatic referral  process.  
 
See also – Automatic referral for consideration of immigration bail . 
 
Consent to bail: Secretary of State  
 
If directions are in place for a detained person to be removed from the UK within 21 
days of the bail hearing, the First -tier Tribunal cannot grant immigration bail to the 
person without the Secretary of State’s consent.  
 
Obtaining consent: process  
 
In cases where the provision applies, the judge of the First -tier Tribunal will explain 
to the detained person at the beginning of the hearing the requirement for the Home 
Office to consent to any grant of bail.  
 
If the judge intends to grant bail, he or she will announce this in open court and will 
issue a note setting out reasons why they are minded to grant bail . The judge will 
then ask the Presenting Officer (PO) if the Secretary of State consents. The PO will 
ask the judge for a brief adjournment in order to seek a decision on consent. It is 
important that consent is sought at that specific point in the hearing , as opposed to 
prior to the hearing, so that any new evidence which emerges at the hearing can be 
taken into account by the Senior Civil Servant (SCS, usually a grade 5) named on 
the bail summary as having responsibility for considering consent.   
 
The SCS will not be familiar with the case. The PO will therefore need to provide 
them with a verbal summary of the case, explain if there is new evidence or new 
barriers to removal which have arisen since the decision to oppose bail was made 
and the judge ’s reasoning for deciding to grant bail.  
 
In giving the SCS a verbal summary of the case, the PO should:  
 
• summarise, briefly, the person’s immigration history, including any history of:  
o complying with a reporting condition  
o non-compliance  
o prior attempts to remove  
• summarise any criminal record the person may have  
• explain if there were any barriers to removal known to the Home Office at the 
time the bail summary was written and when it is expected that those barriers 
will be cleared  
• mention the date for which removal directions are fixed  
 
If there is new evidence or a new barrier to removal, the PO should:  
 
• explain the nature of the new evidence and when it came to light  Page 79 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 • explain the significance or potential significance of that new evidence in terms 
of removing the person  
• explain any new barriers to removal and the potential significance of that new 
barrier on removing the person  
• so far as possible, explain the likelihood of removing that barrier and/or when 
clearing that barrier might be achieved  
 
When explaining the reasons the judge has given for why, in their opinion, the 
person should be granted bail, the PO must explain the:  
 
• factors the judge expressly said they took into account  
• factor or factors that led the judge to reach their decision  
 
It is the SCS’s responsibility to give or refuse to give consent immediately after 
hearing what the PO has explained to them.  
 
The detained person will not be granted bail if the SCS (on behalf of the Secretary of 
State) does not consent.  
 
Consent: considering the request  
 
The consideration of consent must be highly fact specific and based on the 
circumstances of the individual case, including if detention remains  lawful. In 
considering consent, significant weight must be given to the intention of the presiding 
judge to grant bail. The SCS must give proper regard to the judge’s decision and any 
disagreement with this must be on a rational basis.  
 
The power not to give consent may be exercised where for example, it is considered 
that the judge has not correctly weighed the high risk of absconding in coming to the 
decision to grant bail or given enough weight to public protection (if appropriate), th e 
detained person’s immigration history, the risk of future failure to surrender to 
custody, lack of reliable sureties  and lack of an appropriate address. This is not an 
exhaustive list of reasons why consent may be refused.  
 
The power to not give consent cannot be exercised if, during the hearing, the PO 
does not submit evidence showing that directions for the detained person’s removal 
within 21 days are in force.  
 
Consent: refusal  
 
If the SCS refuses consent, the PO will need to contact the decision maker named 
on the bail summary to convey the outcome. Ideally, the PO should do this during 
the adjournment once instructions have been received.  
 
The PO must complete the ‘consideration of consent to bail’ pro forma, setting out 
the reasons the SCS has given. The PO must ensure that a copy of the pro forma is 
emailed  to the decision maker.  
 Page 80 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 On returning to the hearing, the PO must give the completed ‘consideration of 
consent to bail’ pro forma to the judge and inform the judge that a letter outlining the 
Secretary of State’s reasons for refusing consent will be served on both the detained 
person and the First -tier Tribunal within 48 hours.  
 
The judge will inform the detained person  that the Home Office has not consented to 
bail which means the person  will not be granted bail.  
 
A decision to refuse consent will be challengeable by way of judicial review. All 
decisions on consent must therefore be recorded on file and  Atlas . 
 
Refusal of consent: decision maker action  
 
Once the PO informs the decision maker that the SCS (on behalf of the Secretary of 
State) has refused consent to bail, the decision maker must update  Atlas , detailing 
the name of the SCS who refused consent and the reasons for the decision.  
 
The decision maker must, within 48 hours of the bail hearing, prepare written 
notification of the reasons for refusing consent using the IS151F / IS151F CCD 
template  on Atlas . The decision maker must arrange for the completed IS151F / 
IS151F CCD to be served on the detained person and the First -tier Tribunal within 
48 hours of the bail hearing.  
 
See the court tribunal finder service  for telephone and fax numbers  and email 
address  for the relevant IAC hearing centre.  
 
First -tier Tribunal grants immigration bail  
 
If immigration bail is granted by a judge of the First -tier Tribunal it is a matter for the 
judge to decide on the appropriate bail conditions, having regard to requirements 
mentioned in Conditions of immigration bail  and the guidance set out in Guidance on 
Immigration Bail for Judges of the First -tier Tribunal  (Immigration and Asylum 
Chamber).   
 
The PO must specify any conditions which the Secretary of State thinks should apply 
and why, taken from the bail summary (BAIL 505).  
 
Consideration should be given as to whether the case should be transferred to the 
Secretary of State to manage the bail. If transfer is considered appropriate, the PO 
must make oral submissions to the judge requesting this.  
 
If a bail application to the First -tier Tribunal is successful, the Tribunal must notify the 
detained person in writing and give a copy of the notice to the Secretary of State.  
 
The PO must update the bail outcome as a grant on Atlas and upload a hearing 
minute sheet. This should be actioned following the hearing as soon as is reasonably 
possible to assist those responsible for planning the individual’s release.  
 
The notice must specify:  
 Page 81 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 • when the grant of bail starts  
• the bail conditions  
 
The start of a grant of immigration bail may be specified to be conditional on 
arrangements stipulated in the notice being in place to ensure that the person is able 
to comply with the bail conditions. The judge’s clerk will complete and provide the 
necess ary documents to the parties..  
 
If the First -tier Tribunal grants conditional bail but specifies a deadline by which the 
condition must be fulfilled to allow the bail grant to start, the Tribunal’s  decision will 
continue to have effect after the date specified even if the required pre -condition is 
not fulfilled. That is unless the bail grant notice explicitly states that bail lapses if the 
required pre -condition is not fulfilled by the date specifie d. For example, the Tribunal 
may grant bail subject to an address being provided within 14 days to enable the 
person to meet a residence condition. The grant of bail by the Tribunal will not lapse 
automatically if a suitable address is not found by the end of the 14 -day period 
unless that outcome is  mentioned explicitly in the bail grant notice.  
 
There may be circumstances in which the bail grant notice does not provide for bail 
to lapse if a pre-condition is not fulfilled by the start date specified  and there is no 
prospect of it ever being met . An example  is where the Tribunal grants bail subject to 
the Secretary of State providing accommodation , but the  person does not meet the 
criteria to be provided with  such accommodation . In this situation , the decision maker 
will need to do one of the following:  
 
• apply to the Tribunal to vary (by removing) the relevant condition or conditions 
of bail, if the Tribunal has retained bail management  
• vary the relevant condition or conditions of bail as appropriate, if the Tribunal 
has transferred bail management to the Secretary of State  
 
If there is a prospect of a pre -condition being met after a specified bail start date , for 
example because the individual qualifies for accommodation , but a suitable address 
has not yet been found, it will be necessary to seek an extension of time from the 
Tribunal  in order to meet that condition . However, the conditional bail itself will not 
lapse.  
 
When bail has been granted on the condition that accommodation is provided by the 
Secretary of State, the First -tier Tribunal may set a review hearing to take place 
within 28 days of conditional bail being granted to establish the reasons for any 
delays in  the event that suitable accommodation hasn’t been sourced. The Home 
Office will be required to provide evidence of all efforts taken to secure 
accommodation and if a written submission is requested, the conditional bail update 
form (BAIL 506) must be comp leted by casework teams to detail any barriers 
impacting the obtaining of accommodation.  
 
The case  owner must  record on Atlas when a detention restriction is closed and the 
IJ Bail restriction  is effective . In this instance t here is no need to issue an IS.106 
(Release Order) to the IRC as the grant of bail court order is sufficient to release the 
person.  
 Page 82 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 First -tier Tribunal refuses bail  
 
If a bail application to the First -tier Tribunal is unsuccessful, the Tribunal must notify 
the person in writing and give a copy of the notice to the Secretary of State. The 
judge’s clerk will complete and provide the necessary documents to the parties.  
 
The PO must update Atlas  with the bail refusal.  
 
Withdrawal of First -tier Tribunal bail application  
 
Should a bail application be withdrawn, the PO must update Atlas  with one of the 
hearing outcomes:  
 
• withdrawn pre -hearing  
• withdrawn at hearing

 Varying immigration bail conditions  
 
This page tells you about varying the conditions of immigration bail.  
 
See also: Electronic monitoring condition: limitation on variation . 
 
The power to vary the condition or conditions of immigration bail is in paragraph 6 of 
Schedule 10. This provides for any of the conditions of immigration bail granted to a 
person to be amended or removed, or for one or more new conditions from 
immigration bail conditions: general  to be imposed on the person.  
 
The power to vary immigration bail conditions can be exercised by the Secretary of 
State in either of the following circumstances : 
 
• the grant of immigration bail was by the Secretary of State  
• the grant of immigration bail was by the First -tier Tribunal but the Tribunal has 
explicitly directed the power can be exercised by the Secretary of State  
 
The power to vary immigration bail conditions can be exercised by the First -tier 
Tribunal if the immigration bail was granted by the Tribunal and it has not directed 
that the power to vary bail conditions can be exercised by the Secretary of State.  
 
Transfer of bail from the Tribunal to the Secretary of State  
 
In any case where the Tribunal has directed that the Secretary of State can exercise 
the power to vary bail, the power can no longer be exercised by the Tribunal and the 
Tribunal cannot consider an application to vary conditions thereafter. The decision 
whether to direct that the power to vary conditions of bail should be given to the 
Secretary of State rests with the First -tier Tribunal where the Tribunal grants 
immigration bail.  
 
The Secretary of State cannot vary any condition of bail if the Tribunal has not so 
directed and so should consider asking the Tribunal to direct that bail be managed 
by the Secretary of State:  
 
• in the bail summary (BAIL 505)  
• at the bail hearing  
• where the Secretary of State contacts the Tribunal, using form B3, seeking to 
vary the condition or conditions of bail – for example a change to a reporting 
requirement  
• where the Secretary of State informs the Tribunal, using BAIL 303 (Breach of 
Bail Conditions Summary),  that the individual has failed, is failing, or is likely to 
fail to comply with a condition of bail  
 
Transfer of bail with financial condition  
 
If the Tribunal grants bail with a financial condition but agrees to transfer 
management of bail to the Secretary of State, the Home Office decision maker will Page 84 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 need to inform any Financial Condition Supporter of the appropriate method of 
payment using form BAIL 305 (Payment information).  
 
If the Tribunal has set a financial condition and has directed that bail can be varied 
by the Secretary of State, then it is for the Secretary of State to recover any payment 
liability if the bailed person breaches conditions to which the financial conditi on is 
attached.  
 
If the Tribunal does not direct that the Secretary of State manage the case, then the 
Tribunal keeps complete control, including any decision to vary the conditions, 
dealing with any breach of conditions and recovering any payment liability under a 
financi al condition.  
 
Variation of bail by the Secretary of State  
 
Decision makers must use each meaningful interaction with the person or the case 
as an opportunity to proactively review the person’s bail conditions. This is to ensure 
bail conditions remain appropriate in all the circumstances. Decision makers must 
consider all requests for variation and grant reasonable requests where it is 
appropriate to do so , having regard to the matters listed under Exercising the power 
to grant immigration bail . However, updating a change of circumstance (for example , 
a change of contact telephone number) would not constitute a variation of a bail 
condition unless a condition was for the person to be contactable on a specified 
telephone number.  
 
If the Secretary of State exercises the power to vary immigration bail conditions, the 
decision maker must issue a grant/variation of bail form (BAIL 201) setting out the 
terms of the variation. The re -issued BAIL 201 must contain all the immigration bail 
conditions that continue to apply to the individual, not just the condition that was 
varied.  
 
If there is a financial condition attached to one of more of the varied conditions, the 
decision maker must notify any Financial Condition Supporter and ask them to sign a 
new Financial Condition Supporter agreement (BAIL 301).  
 
If the Secretary of State refuses a request to vary immigration bail conditions, the 
decision maker must issue a notification of refusal of request to vary bail conditions 
form (BAIL 406).  
 
Where bail conditions are varied, the decision maker must update  Atlas.   
 
Variation of bail by the Tribunal  
 
Where the Home Office applies to the First -tier Tribunal for a variation of bail 
conditions  the: 
 
• decision maker completes the B3 (Variation of Bail Conditions and Transfer) 
and sends it to the ALAR Bail Team  
• ALAR Bail Team  sends the completed B3 to the Tribunal for consideration  Page 85 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 • Tribunal sends the completed B3 to the bail party requesting a written response  
 
Where the bailed person applies for a variation of bail conditions  the: 
 
• applicant must complete form B2 (Tribunal’s Application for Variation form) and 
send it to the Tribunal  
• Tribunal notifies ALAR Bail Team  and requests a response from the Home 
Office  
• ALAR Bail Team  contacts decision maker to confirm whether the Home Office 
agrees or not – the decision maker has 7 days to respond  
• decision maker will then complete the Home Office response to the variation 
request (BAIL 304) and forward to the ALAR Bail Team  
• ALAR Bail Team  will send the above notice to the Tribunal for consideration, 
together with any request to transfer management of bail to the Secretary of 
State  
 
Variation: consent  
 
Where both sides consent to the variation requested, the Tribunal will normally 
consider the request on the papers. The Tribunal will send the bail decision to the 
bail party and the decision to vary/to transfer bail to the ALAR Bail Team . The ALAR 
Bail Team  then inform the decision maker of the outcome.  
 
Variation: refusal of consent  
 
If one side disagrees, the Tribunal will write to the bailed person and the ALAR Bail 
Team , issuing an oral hearing notification. The ALAR Bail Team  will be notified of the 
listing and will inform the decision maker. The hearing follows the normal bail 
process. The ALAR Bail Team  will update Atlas  with the outcome.  
 
Variation: notification of outcome  
 
If the First -tier Tribunal exercises, or refuses to exercise, the power to vary 
immigration bail conditions, the Tribunal must notify the person who is on 
immigration bail, in writing, and provide a copy of the notice to Secretary of State.  
 
Electronic monitoring condition: limitation on variation  
 
The First -tier Tribunal may not exercise the power to amend an electronic monitoring 
condition imposed on a person granted immigration bail from detention, or liable to 
be detained, under:  
 
• paragraph 2(1), (2) or (3) of Schedule 3 to that Act (detention pending 
deportation)  
• section 36(1) of the UK Borders Act 2007 (detention pending automatic 
deportation)

 Interim relief in the form of immigration 
bail 
 
Notifying Counsel on bail conditions where a person is 
seeking release from detention as interim relief from the 
High Court  
 
Where a detained person has lodged a judicial review regarding the lawfulness of 
their ongoing detention, and  it is possible that interim relief in the form of release 
from detention is sought from the High Court, the following process will apply.  
 
Instructions must be provided by the relevant case work team to the Litigation 
Operations caseworker on the appropriate immigration bail conditions to be set if the 
person is released from detention following the court’s decision. A request must also 
be ma de to transfer management of bail to the Secretary of State in the event that 
the court does not automatically direct management to the Secretary of State.  
 
On receiving the instructions, the Litigation Operations caseworker must provide 
these proposed bail conditions to GLD, to ensure they are included within the 
instructions for Counsel acting on behalf of the Secretary of State in the case.  
 
Cases which have been granted release by the High Court  
 
Where a person’s release has previously been ordered by the High Court, and it is 
considered the bail conditions set should be varied, for example to include reporting 
or EM conditions where necessary, caseworkers will first need to check whether the 
High Court has transferred management of bail to the Secretary of State.  
 
Where this is not the case, caseworkers will need to set out the bail conditions to be 
varied and provide these to the Litigation Operations caseworker. The Litigation 
Operations caseworker will instruct GLD to make an application to the High Court to 
request a variation of bail conditions, and transfer of management of bail to the 
Secretary of State.  
 
Until the High Court varies bail or transfers the management of bail to the Secretary 
of State, reporting and EM conditions cannot be imposed where they have not 
already been set by the High Court. Further requests to vary this period of bail to 
include th ese conditions will need to be made to the High Court.

 Meeting bail conditions: Secretary of 
State support  
 
With immediate effect and until further notice, the use of Meeting bail conditions: 
Secretary of State support as set out in this instruction is suspended and the 
separate  Immigration bail interim guidance  must be used instead.  
 
This page tells you about measures in place that you may use to help a person meet 
immigration bail conditions in specified circumstances.  
 
Accommodation  
 
There may be circumstances where a person is granted immigration bail subject to 
a residence condition requiring them to live at a specified address, and the 
person would not be able to support himself or herself at that address  without 
the assistance of the Secretary of State. Under paragraph 9 of Schedule 10, the 
Secretary of State may provide, or arrange for the provision of, facilities for the 
person’s accommodation at that address to enable the bail condition to be met, but 
only in exceptional circumst ances.  
 
Exceptional circumstances  
 
The power may be exercised only if the Secretary of State thinks that there are 
exceptional circumstances to justify doing so. The types of cases where exceptional 
circumstances will normally justify providing accommodation under paragraph 9 of 
Schedule 10 are SIAC cases , Harm cases  and European Convention on Human 
Rights: Article 3 cases .   
 
SIAC cases  
 
These are  cases involving  people  granted bail by the Special Immigration Appeals 
commission (SIAC), where exceptionally strict bail conditions, including a residence 
condition, are imposed to control the risk posed by the individual  
 
Harm cases  
 
Cases involving:  
 
• people  – including Foreign National Offenders (FNOs) – who are granted bail 
and who are currently assessed by Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service 
(HMPPS) as being at a high or very high risk of causing serious harm to the 
public  
• FNOs at high risk of harmful reoffending against an individual – for example, 
offences of domestic burglary, robbery, sexual assaults and violence – who are 
assessed using the Offender  Group  Reconviction  Scale (OGRS) with a 
minimum score of 70%  
 Page 90 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 where that person has nowhere suitable to live in accordance with their probation 
licence and/or multi -agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA), for a limited 
period , or otherwise at the discretion of the Home Secretary in the interest of public 
protection.  
 
Serious Harm: definition  
 
For the purpose of Harm Cases  in this section, the expression ‘serious harm ’ is 
defined as:  
 
‘An event, which is life -threatening and/or traumatic, from which recovery, whether 
physical  or psychological, can be expected to be difficult or impossible. ’ 
 
The level of risk of serious harm is the likelihood of this event happening. The levels 
are: 
 
• low: current evidence does not indicate a likelihood of causing serious harm  
• medium : there are identifiable indicators of serious harm – the offender has the 
potential to cause such harm but is unlikely to do so unless there is a change in 
circumstances, for example failure to take medication, loss of accommodation, 
relationship breakdow n, drug or alcohol misuse  
• high: there are identifiable indicators of risk of serious harm – the potential 
event could happen at any time and the impact would be serious  
• very high : there is an imminent risk of serious harm – the potential event is 
more likely than not to happen imminently and the impact would be serious  
 
The categorisation of risk is refined by reference to those who may be the subject of 
that harm; they include:  
 
• the public , either generally or a specific group such as the elderly, vulnerable 
adults – for example, those with a learning disability  – women or a minority 
ethnic group  
• known adult  such as a previous victim or partner  
• children , who may be vulnerable to harm of various kinds, including violent or 
sexual behaviour, emotional harm or neglect  
• staff, anyone working with the offender whether from Probation, the Prison 
Service, the police or any other agency – this relates to all forms of abuse, 
threats and assaults that arise out of their employment  
 
European Convention on Human Rights: Article  3 cases  
 
It may be appropriate to consider using the power to provide accommodation under 
paragraph 9 to accommodate individuals who are not SIAC  or harm  cases,  but only 
usually where both of  the following circumstances apply:  
 
• they do not have adequate accommodation or the means of obtaining it    
• the provision of accommodation is necessary in order to avoid a breach of their 
human rights  (usually rights under Article 3 ECHR)  
 Page 91 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 The following categories of migrant will in prac tice be able to obtain adequate 
accommodation from another source . It will therefore not usually be necessary to 
provide accommodation under the paragraph 9 power for the purposes of preventing 
a breach of their Art icle 3 ECHR rights:    
 
• asylum seekers : they may be provided with accommodation under the powers 
set out in sections 95 or 98 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 if they do 
not have adequate accommodation or the means of obtaining it  - if an asylum 
seeker being released from immigration detention on bail does not appear to 
have adequate accommodation or the means of obtaining it and is not a SIAC  
or Harm  case it w ill usually be appropriate to arrange accommodation under 
section 98 of the 1999 Act  
• failed asylum seekers : they may be provided with accommodation under the 
powers set out in section 4(2) of the 1999 Act if they do not have adequate 
accommodation or the means of obtaining it  
• other migrants who have dependent children : if the family cannot obtain 
adequate accommodation it will usually be available through the duties local 
authorities have to safeguard and promote the welfare of children under 
Section 17 of the Children Act 1989 , or the equivalent in the devolved 
administrations  
• migrants accommodated under the provisions of the Care Act 2014 , or the 
equivalent in the devolved administrations – generally, they will have been 
accommodated because they have a serious disability , exceptionally, however, 
accommodation may be arranged temporarily under the power in paragraph 9 
whilst the case is referred to a local authority and pending a decision by that 
local authority as to whether the duty to provide accommodation under the Care  
Act 2014 (or equivalent) applies  
 
Undertaking a Human Rights Assessment  
 
The consideration of whether the provision of accommodation is necessary to avoid 
a breach of the person’s human rights will usually require an assessment of whether 
they are likely to suffer inhuman or degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the 
Euro pean Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if they are not provided with 
accommodation and other assistance to meet their daily living needs while they are 
in the UK. However, decision makers should only provide accommodation for these 
reasons if it is clear t hat the person cannot reasonably be expected to leave the 
United Kingdom. Otherwise, individuals can avoid a breach of their human rights by 
leaving the UK.  
 
Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is the prohibition on 
torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  
 
When it appears on a fair and objective assessment of all relevant facts and 
circumstances that an individual applicant faces an imminent prospect of serious 
suffering caused or materially aggravated by denial of shelter, food or the most basic 
necessities  of life , this is likely to be considered inhuman or degrading treatment 
contrary to Article 3 of the ECHR (see: R (Limbuela) v Secretary of State [2005] 
UKHL 66).  
 Page 92 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 The decision maker will therefore need to assess whether the consequences of a 
decision to deny a person accommodation would result in a person suffering such 
treatment. To make that assessment it may be necessary to consider if the person 
can obtain accommodation and support from charitable or community sources or 
through the lawful endeavours of their families or friends.  
 
Where the decision maker concludes that there is no support from any of these 
sources then there will be a positive obligation on the Secretary of State to 
accommodate the individual in order to avoid a breach of Article 3 of the ECHR.  
 
However, if the person is able to return to their country of origin , including using 
support available under the Voluntary Returns Service , and thus avoid the 
consequences of being left without shelter or funds, the situation outlined above is 
changed. This is because of the following:  
 
• there is no duty under the European Convention on Human Rights to support 
foreign nationals who are freely able to return home (see: R(Kimani) v Lambeth 
LBC [2003] EWCA Civ 1150)  
• if there are no legal or practical obstacles to return home, the denial of support 
by a local authority does not constitute a breach of Human Rights (see: R (W) v 
Croydon LBC  [2007] EWCA Civ 266)  
 
A genuine obstacle would only usually exist if either:  
 
• the person is unable to leave the UK because of a physical impediment, or 
other medical reason :   
o the test here is usually whether the person is physically able to travel by air 
to their country of origin or another country where they may be admitted  
o a person who claims to be unfit to travel will usually need to provide 
supporting evidence from a medical practitioner  
• the person is unable to leave the UK because they do not have the necessary 
travel documentation but are taking reasonable steps to obtain one:  
o reasonable steps should usually be taken to mean that they have applied for 
the necessary travel document from their national embassy, but may include 
where they are complying with Home Offices processes to obtain an 
emergency travel document to facilitate  their return  
 
Unwillingness to return is not the same as inability to return, so where there is a 
genuine obstacle to return the person can be expected to take steps to resolve the 
obstacle where it is reasonable to do so (for example by applying for a travel 
document t hrough the national embassy or high commission).  
 
If there are no legal or practical obstacles preventing the person leaving the United 
Kingdom, it will usually be difficult for a person to establish that the Secretary of 
State is required to provide support in order to avoid breaching their human rights.   
 
Clearly, however, if there are obstacles in place that mean the person cannot leave 
the United Kingdom, or they are taking reasonable steps to put themselves in a 
position whereby they can leave the United Kingdom but there is likely to be an 
unavoidable d elay in those steps reaching fruition, then it may be necessary to Page 93 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 continue to provide accommodation support to avoid the inhuman treatment and 
breach of Article 3 rights described above.  
 
If a decision maker is unsure as to whether it would be appropriate to provide, or 
continue to provide, support in any given case, a senior caseworker should be 
consulted as part of your decision -making process.  
 
Other categories of migrant likely meet the Article 3 test  
 
There are a small number of migrants who are likely to require accommodation 
under paragraph 9 to avoid a breach of their Article 3 rights, if they do not have 
accommodation or the means of obtaining  it. They will have at one time claimed 
asylum but are not eligible to receive accommodation under sections 95, 98 or 4(2) 
of the 1999 Act. These are:  
 
• people who have withdrawn their asylum claim, including where the claim has 
been treated as imp liedly withdrawn under paragraph 333 C of the Immigration 
Rules, but have since made further submissions and the submissions are still 
outstanding  – if it is decided to treat the further submissions as a fresh claim for 
asylum the person will be eligible to receive support under section 95 or 98 of 
the 1999  Act 
• people who have withdrawn their asylum claim but are taking reasonable steps 
to leave the UK  or are temporarily unable to take those steps because of a 
physical impediment or some other medical reason  
• people who were refused asylum and exhausted their appeal rights before they 
reached 18 years of age  and who are not eligible to receive support under the 
Children Act 1989 or equivalent legislation in Scotland, Wales and Northern 
Ireland  
 
Limited period: definition  
 
Accommodation support is provided for a limited period only, whilst the supported 
person makes arrangements either to leave the UK or to move to alternative 
accommodation. This period is expected to be no longer than three months, unless 
there are exceptional circumstances to justify continuing it, for example:  
 
• European Convention on Human Rights – Article 3 cases  
• public protection issues  
• the person is compliant with the returns process and is likely to be returned 
within a reasonable timescale  
 
Right to Rent  
 
People who have been granted immigration bail by the Tribunal subject to a 
residence condition and/or electronic monitoring condition are exempt from Right to 
Rent requirements and Atlas must be updated  to reflect  permission to rent . These 
people therefore have the option to secure accommodation at their own expense.  
 Page 94 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 Provision of accommodation  
 
Where a person applies for bail to the Tribunal and the Home Office considers that a 
residence condition is necessary were bail to be granted, the decision maker must 
note this in the bail summary (BAIL 505), along with information as to the type of 
accommodation required and the reasons why this is necessary.  
 
FNOs granted bail whilst still under prison licence will need to have their proposed 
bail address approved by HMPPS (or devolved equivalents in Scotland and Northern 
Ireland). The agreed timeframe for HMPPS to consider an address is approximately 
9 weeks. The police and other related partners may also have an interest in 
approving addresses for those who are not under licence.  
 
Types of bail accommodation  
 
There are 3 different levels of bail accommodation as follows:  
 
• level 1 – initial accommodation – high, multiple -occupancy accommodation,  
this:  
o accommodates females as well as single persons of either gender and lone 
parents  
o contains shared accommodation spaces used by families and individuals  
o is located in high -density urban residential areas  
o is unlikely to be suitable for FNOs who meet the exceptional criteria for 
accommodation provision  
• level 2 – standard dispersal accommodation , mostly high multiple -occupancy 
accommodation, individual accommodation but often with shared common 
spaces, lone adult males do not share accommodation with families or lone 
females  
• level 3 – complex bail dispersal accommodation , increased liaison with local 
authorities in sourcing appropriate accommodation , accommodation provider’s 
staff have specialist training and increased risk awareness , the authority can 
request specific location or specify how far the service user should be from 
local amenities , schools  and so on,  lone adult males do not share 
accommodation with families or lone females  
 
FNOs receiving support because they meet the harm criteria  will require Level 3 
accommodation (Complex Bail Dispersal Accommodation). For vulnerable persons 
who are not FNOs, the suitable accommodation level will vary according to the 
individual’s needs.  
 
Paragraph 3(8) of Schedule 10 provides that the commencement of a grant of bail 
may be specified to be conditional on arrangements specified in the grant of bail 
notice being in place to ensure that the person is able to comply with the bail 
conditions. The authority granting bail (First -tier Tribunal or Secretary of State) may 
use the provision to postpone  the start of a grant of immigration bail  until appropriate 
accommodation is available, if it is anticipated that there will be  a delay . 
 Page 95 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 Requests for accommodation  
 
Individuals who are SIAC  cases or foreign national offenders are not required to 
make a separate request for accommodation under paragraph 9 of Schedule 10. 
They should set out their needs in the bail application form, B1 or BAIL 401 as 
appropriate, and the se will be assessed as part of the bail consideration process. All 
other i ndividuals w ho are not asylum seekers or failed asylum seekers will need to 
set out the reasons why they consider that accommodation should be provided 
under paragraph 9 of Schedule 10 on form BAIL 409 , in addition to  their application 
for bail . This applies to those in immigration detention and those on immigration bail 
in the community. The form is included in the immigration bail pack given to detained 
persons on induction to detention and is also available on GOV.UK for all who need 
to use it. The completed BAIL 409 must be sent to the address shown on the form.  
 
Generally, decisions on BAIL 409 applications from non-detained  people should be 
made within 5 working days, but decision makers must give careful consideration to 
any additional factors that call for the case to be given higher priority and make the 
decision more quickly.  
 
If any of the following circumstances apply, the decision maker must make 
reasonable efforts to decide the application within 2 working days (the list is not 
exhaustive):  
 
• people who are street homeless  
• families with children under the age of 18  
• people with disabilities (physical and/or mental)  
• elderly people  
• pregnant women  
• people who have been subjected to torture, rape or other serious forms of 
psychological, physical or sexual violence  
• potential victims of trafficking  
 
Where a person requests bail accommodation but the decision maker considers that 
they do not meet the criteria for accommodation under paragraph 9 of Schedule 10 , 
the request must be rejected using the appropriate response in the Refusal to 
Provide Accommodation form (BAIL 203).  This should be done regardless of 
whether the person has been granted bail in principle.  
 
Asylum seekers and failed asylum seekers who are detained under immigration 
powers and who are n ot SIAC cases or foreign national offenders may be 
considered for accommodation provided under section 98 , 95 or section 4(2) of the 
Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 and should contact Migration Help on 0808  8000 
631 for advice and assistance on how to make an application. Any agreement to 
provide accommodation under the powers will be subject to the person subsequently 
being granted bail. Accommodation will norma lly be provided to asylum seekers 
under section 98 of the 1999 Act unless there are reasons why they are unsuitable 
for this form of support.    
 Page 96 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 Travel expenses  
 
If there are exceptional circumstances for doing so, the Secretary of State may make 
a payment to a person on immigration bail to cover the person’s cost of travel to 
comply with a bail condition. An example of exceptional circumstances that may 
justify ex ercising the power to pay travel expenses is where the individual is subject 
to a reporting condition but the Secretary of State is unwilling to vary that condition to 
move it to a closer location to where the person is living and they are unable to afford  
the additional expense.  
 
See Reporting and Offender Management  for full details of the travel expenses 
process.

 Automatic referral for consideration of 
immigration bail  
 
This page tells you about the legal obligation to refer detained persons to the First -
tier Tribunal automatically, to be considered for immigration bail.  
 
Paragraph 11 of Schedule 10 imposes a duty on the Secretary of State to arrange a 
referral to the First -tier Tribunal for a decision on whether to grant immigration bail to 
a person detained under  any of the following : 
 
• paragraph 16(1), (1A) or 2 of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971  
• section 62 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  
 
The Secretary of State must make the referral to the Tribunal four months after the 
beginning of the person’s detention (unless the Tribunal has considered a bail 
application in respect of the person in the interim period) and every 4 months 
thereafter.  
 
If a person has submitted a bail application himself or herself in the interim period, 
the four -month period for automatic referral is calculated from the date the Tribunal 
last considered whether to grant immigration bail to the person.  
 
A reference made by the Secretary of State to the Tribunal, automatically, for 
consideration of immigration bail is to be treated as a bail application to the Tribunal. 
If a person withdraws such an application, the four -month period for the next 
automatic  referral is calculated from the date the application is withdrawn.  
 
If a person makes an application for immigration bail to the First -tier Tribunal but the 
Tribunal is prevented from granting bail because of the Secretary of State has 
refused consent , that particular consideration of bail by the Tribunal is disregarded in 
calculating the four -month period for automatic referral.  
 
When the duty does not apply  
 
The duty to arrange consideration of bail before the Tribunal does not apply to those  
detained pending deportation under paragraph 2(1), (2) or (3) of Schedule 3 to 1971 
Act or section 36(1) of the UK Borders Act 2007.  
 
It also does not apply if:  
 
• section 3(2) of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997 (persons 
detained in the interests of national security) applied to the person  
• the person has given  – and has not withdrawn  – written notice that he or she 
does not wish for his or her case to be referred to the Tribunal for consideration 
for immigration bail in line with the duty  
 Page 98 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 Relevant date for referral  
 
A referral must be made where 4 calendar months have elapsed since the most 
recent of the following events, the:  
 
• start date of the person’s current period in immigration detention  
• First-tier Tribunal last considered whether to grant the person bail  
• person withdrew an application for bail made on their behalf by the Home Office  
• person withdrew notice that they did not wish for the Home Office to refer them 
to the Tribunal for bail consideration  
 
Automatic referral process  
 
When a detained case is allocated, the decision maker must  update Atlas.   Following 
on from a Case Progression Panel’s decision to maintain detention after 3 months, 
the person will be issued with an automatic bail referral opt out  or opt in form with 
information on the process (BAIL 501). This will be monitored after 5 days and the 
appropriate action taken in view of the person’s response.  
 
Opt in  
 
If the person agrees to opt in  to the automatic referral process they will be asked to 
complete the Tribunal bail application form (B1) but not to sign  the form. Forms B1 
and BAIL 502 (Automatic Bail Referral Covering Letter) will be sent to the ALAR Bail 
Team who will forward them to the hearing centre and the case will be dealt with 
under the standard application process.  
 
If the person signs the B1 Tribunal bail application form, the Tribunal may take this 
as an actual application for bail by the person and may not treat it as a referral from 
the Home Office. In such a case, the BAIL 502 should not be sent; instead the 
signed B1 should be sent to the ALAR Bail Team  who will forward to the Tribunal as 
a normal application for bail.  
 
Opt out  
 
If the person wishes to withdraw from the automatic referral process , they should 
complete the BAIL 501 form accordingly and return this to the decision maker. The 
decision maker must link the BAIL 501 to the file and update Atlas to reflect the opt -
out.  If the person changes their mind , they can opt back into the process using the 
BAIL 501 form.  
 
No response  
 
If the person refuses to cooperate with any part of the process and no B1 or BAIL 
501 form is received within 5 days of their being notified, the decision maker must 
update  Atlas and send an Automatic Referral Covering Letter – no response (BAIL 
503) to the Tribunal requesting a hearing and send the documentation to the ALAR 
Bail Admin Team . The ALAR Bail Team will send the BAIL 503 to the hearing centre Page 99 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 and the case will be dealt with under the standard application process but without 
input from the person.  
 
Auto-referral and accommodation  
 
The person will need to detail on the application where they plan to live or if they 
have no fixed accommodation. If they are a failed asylum seeker or have a current 
asylum claim and wish to apply for support under section 4(2) or section 95 of the 
Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 , they will need to do this themselves.  
 
If the Secretary of State is proposing a residence condition (for example, to avoid a 
breach of the person’s ECHR Article 3 rights), the decision -making team will need to 
provide this information on the referral. If the individual will be unable to support  
themselves, the decision -making team will need to arrange the accommodation.  
 
See Meeting bail conditions: Secretary of State Support  for further information.

 Non-compliance with immigration bail: 
administrative penalties  
 
This page tells you about the administrative penalties that may be applied if a person 
does not comply with one or more conditions of their grant of immigration bail.  
 
Breach of a bail condition: Secretary of State  
 
A person may breach one or more conditions of bail. This could, for example, be by 
working where this is prohibited or by failing to attend a reporting event at the time 
and date specified. Reporting centres are only responsible for managing those bail 
conditions in relation to reporting.  
 
Where there is no financial condition and the Secretary of State intends to take 
action in response to the breach, by varying bail conditions, detaining, arresting for 
the criminal offence (see Non-compliance with immigration bail: criminal penalties ), 
the individual must be notified in writing of the alleged breach using form BAIL 204.  
 
The BAIL 204 gives the individual the opportunity to make representations against 
whether a breach occurred or to provide a reasonable excuse for the breach. The 
individual has 10 working days to respond. Any representations a person makes 
about a breach o f bail conditions will not affect the person’s case progression, 
including detention and removal – the entire breach process runs parallel to case 
progression.  
 
The BAIL 204 notice must also be served if the breach is likely to result in the refusal 
of leave under the Immigration Rules or if the current bail conditions prohibit work but 
the individual submits evidence of employment as part of their application for  leave.  
 
For information on breach of a bail condition and recovering a payment under a 
financial condition, see Recovery of payment under financial condition . 
 
Decision makers must record breaches of bail on Atlas or the port /case file. On the 
breaches screen, under Restriction Breach  tab, you must select the relevant 
breach from the drop -down menu. Date Breached  should reflect the date the breach 
occurred. If the bailed person or a Financial Condition Supporter (where there is one) 
provides information and the decision maker considers that a breach did not actually 
occur, or that there were mitigating circumstanc es that negate taking any action, 
then the decision maker must update the Date Resolved  field.  
 
If the individual does not provide any information in response to the BAIL 204 notice, 
or the decision maker concludes that breach action is necessary having considered 
the information provided, the decision maker may:  
 
• vary the conditions of the person’s immigration bail   
• arrange administrative arrest for breach of immigration bail , if appropriate  
 Page 101 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
  
Recovery of payment under financial condition  
 
If a person fails to comply with a condition of bail to which a financial condition is 
attached, the relevant sum specified under the financial condition will become 
payable by the bailed person and/or the Financial Condition Supporter.  
 
Any sum specified in the financial condition does not become payable unless the 
Secretary of State gives the person liable to make the payment an opportunity to 
provide reasons for not being required to pay the sum of money.  
 
Where the person is granted bail by the Secretary of State, or where the Tribunal 
has directed that the Secretary of State has power to vary conditions of bail, the 
decision maker must serve a BAIL 208 on any person who is liable for the payment 
(either th e bailed person or any Financial Condition Supporter) informing the 
recipients of the alleged breach of condition or conditions so that representations 
may be made in writing to the Home Office. The person liable to make the payment 
has 28 days to submit r epresentations against payment and the Home Office must 
then respond within 10 working days of the date of receipt.  
 
If the Home Office accepts the representations made against payment liability, the 
individual and the Financial Condition Supporter will be notified in writing that no 
further action is being taken at this time.  
 
If the Home Office does not accept the representations made against payment 
liability or no representation is received, then financial recovery action  will begin.  
 
Initiating financial recovery action  
 
In any case where the decision maker decides to seek recovery of payment liability 
under a financial condition, the decision maker must:  
 
• vary one or more conditions of the person’s continuing immigration bail  
• send any Financial Condition Supporter a new BAIL.301 to sign and return  
• issue a new BAIL 201 to the bailed person  
 
This is necessary to ensure that the parties are aware that:  
 
• the bailed person remains subject to bail conditions even though a breach 
process is ongoing  
• any further breach or breaches may result in new penalties  
 
If no signed BAIL.301 is received from the Financial Condition Supporter within 14 
calendar days, you must consider that the Financial Condition Supporter no longer 
supports the bailed person  in respect of their ongoing bail conditions . In light of this, 
consider whether bail needs to be varied or , where applicable in the individual 
circumstances direct the detention of the person under a provision mentioned in 
Eligibility for immigration bail .  
 Page 102 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 The Financial Condition Supporter remains liable for the period of bail related to the 
breach, and Financial recovery action, below, must be taken  even where a new 
BAIL.301 is not received . 
 
To initiate financial recovery action, the decision maker must complete BAIL 307 and 
refer it to the Compliance Monitoring and Workflow Team (CMWT) within Foreign 
National Offender Returns Command . CMWT will then update the Civil Penalty 
Compliance Team (CPCT) spreadsheet.  
 
In Foreign National Offender Returns Command cases, it will not be necessary for 
decision makers to complete and refer the BAIL 307 as instructed above. CMWT will 
initiate the financial recovery action for Foreign National Offender Returns Command 
following a suspected breach.  
 
Once CMWT updates the CPCT spreadsheet, CPCT will issue form BAIL 302 
(Penalty Notice) to the individual and/or Financial Condition Supporter. The Financial 
Condition Supporter is given 10 working days to make the payment in accordance 
with the information  provided in the BAIL 201 (notification of grant/variation of 
immigration bail), the BAIL 301 (Financial Condition Supporter agreement), or the 
BAIL 305 (payment information) forms. Where no payment is received within the 
appropriate timescale, then the pa yment liability may be recovered.  
 
The payment recovery is then managed by Home Office Shared Services within a 
60-day three -letter process. If payment is still not received, the debt is then 
transferred to the Home Office Debt Strategy  Team where it can be placed with  debt 
recovery agents via the Debt Management Services  contract . Enforcement action 
may be taken if no payment is received.  
 
In England and Wales, a payment liability under a financial condition is recoverable 
as if it were payable under an order of the county court in England and Wales.  
 
In Scotland, a payment liability under a financial condition may be enforced in the 
same manner as an extract registered decree arbitral bearing a warrant for execution 
issued by the sheriff court or any sheriffdom in Scotland.  
 
In Northern Ireland, a payment liability under a financial condition is recoverable as if 
it were payable under an order of a county court in Northern Ireland.  
 
Atlas must be updated o nce the payment is recovered . 
 
Breach of EM immigration bail conditions  
 
Any breach of EM related immigration bail conditions will be notified to the Home 
Office by the EM Supplier .  
 
Following a breach of EM conditions, it will be necessary to seek explanation for the 
breach from the person/the person’s representative using form BAIL 204. The 
timings outlined in EM and linked Supplementary Conditions:  review  will apply.  
 Page 103 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 If the person is on a non -fitted EM device, and due to the breach may be considered 
for a variation of bail onto a fitted EM device a Bail 211 should be provided to seek 
representations regarding a variation of device.  
 
Where the person is an FNO consideration of any response will be made by the EM 
Hub, for all other individuals the consideration will be made by the responsible case 
work unit.  
 
Where the explanation submitted is not considered sufficient to discount the breach 
(or where no explanation is submitted) the following action may be taken:  
 
• Offender Manager Intervention and potential Licence Recall  
• variation of bail  
• casework prioritisation  
• Financial Condition Supporter  
• first-tier tribunal  
• consider detention for removal  
• administrative arrest 
• prosecution  
 
The appropriate action will depend on the nature and frequency of breach, the level 
of harm posed by the person and any previous history of non -compliance. 
Prosecution is more likely to occur where the breach relates to refusal to comply with 
induction onto EM, deliberate attempts to remove or damage a device, to tamper 
with the device so that it fails to operate correctly. Any prosecution will be 
undertaken by the Home Office under Section 24(1) of the Immigration Act 1971.

Arrest by immigration officer or constable  
 
Administrative arrest  
 
The power of an immigration officer or a constable to arrest a person on immigration 
bail, without warrant, is in paragraph 10 of Schedule 10 to the Immigration Act 201 6. Page 104 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
  
This provides for an immigration officer or a constable to arrest a person on 
immigration bail if the immigration officer or constable has reasonable grounds for:  
 
• believing that the person is likely to fail to comply with a bail condition  
• suspecting that the person is failing, or has failed, to comply with a bail 
condition  
 
Search and arrest with warrant  
 
If an appropriate judicial officer is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for 
believing that a person liable to be arrested for breach of immigration bail is to be 
found on any premises, the judicial officer may issue a warrant. The warrant would 
be one authorising any immigration offi cer or constable to enter, by reasonable force 
if necessary, the premises named in the warrant in order to search for and arrest the 
person.  
 
For this purpose, an appropriate judicial officer means, in relation to:  
 
• England and Wales, a justice of peace  
• Scotland, the sheriff or a justice of peace  
• Northern Ireland, a lay magistrate  
 
The safeguarding and execution of warrant provisions set out in sections 28J and 
28K of the Immigration Act 1971 apply also to a warrant under Schedule 10.  
 
For this purpose, premises is defined as follows , in: 
 
• England and Wales, it has the same meaning as in the Police and Criminal 
Evidence Act 1984  
• Scotland, it has the same meaning as in section 412 of the Proceeds of Crime 
Act 2002  
• Northern Ireland, it has the same meaning as in the Police and Criminal 
Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989  
 
Action following arrest  
 
A person arrested under paragraph 10 for breach of immigration bail must, as soon 
as is practicable after arrest, be brought before the relevant authority, that is:  
 
• Secretary of State, if the grant of immigration bail was by the Secretary of 
State or the Tribunal has directed that the power to vary the person’s 
immigration bail conditions is exercisable by the Secretary of State  
• First-tier Tribunal in all other cases  
 
Until such time as the person is brought before the relevant authority, the person 
may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of State.  
 Page 105 of 113 Published for Home Office staff on 18 March 2024  
 Where the arrested person had been granted bail by the First -tier Tribunal, the 
decision maker must also follow the process for notifying the Tribunal of the 
suspected breach. For further information, s ee Breach of a bail condition – Tribunal . 
 
Once the person is brought before the relevant authority, the relevant authority will 
decide whether the arrested person has broken or is likely to break any of the 
immigration bail conditions. If the answer is yes, the relevant authority must do one 
of the following : 
 
• direct the detention of the person under a provision mentioned in Eligibility for 
immigration bail  under which the person is liable to be detained  
• grant the person immigration bail subject to the same or different conditions, 
which must comply with the requirements set out in Conditions of immigration 
bail 
 
However, if the relevant authority decides that the arrested person has not broken, 
and is not likely to break any of the immigration bail conditions, the relevant authority 
must grant the person immigration bail subject to the same conditions that applied  
prior to the person’s arrest. A grant of bail in this situation must comply with the 
requirements set out in Conditions of immigration bail  and it does not prevent a 
subsequent exercise of the power to vary the conditions of the immigration bail.

conditions of a grant of immigration bail.  
 
Under section 24(1)(h) of the Immigration Act 1971, a person on immigration bail, 
within the meaning of Schedule 10 to the Immigration Act 2016, who breaches a bail

 Asylum claimants: additional 
information  
 
This page tells  you about imposing conditions on asylum claimants.  
 
Asylum claims made by Illegal entrants  
 
An illegal entrant (including an overstayer and someone determined to have entered 
using deception) who is discovered may claim asylum before a decision is taken to 
serve a liability to removal notice (for example a Notice of Liability to Remove ). Such 
a person cannot be removed before their asylum claim is decided or decided and 
certified.  
 
See Enforced removals: notice periods . 
 
For Border Force  cases, officers must use the IS81. Border Force officers must 
follow the clandestine guidance  in immigration guidance for Border Force.  
 
The person should be issued with a notification of grant or variation of bail form 
(BAIL 201) with at least one condition set unless detention is appropriate and 
considered necessary. See: Detention general guidance . 
 
The decision maker must record the action taken on Atlas  and the person’s case /port 
file. 
 
For further information see:  
 
• Conditions of immigration bail  
• Immigration Bail: Secretary of State  
 
Asylum claims from persons with leave  
 
An individual who claims asylum in the United Kingdom while they have valid leave 
to enter or remain  in another category cannot be placed on immigration bail. They 
may be subject to conditions under section 71 of the Nationality, Immigration and 
Asylum Act 2002 instead. Section 71 allows such a person to be made subject to 
such conditions as may be place d on a grant of immigration bail. Such persons 
should be served with a Notice of Restriction to a person who has made an in -
country in -time claim for asylum  (IS.248).  
 
A person who breaches conditions under section 71 will become liable to detention 
under paragraph 16 of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 and may then be 
detained under that provision or granted bail under Schedule 10.  
 
Atlas must be updated to reflect the conditions set.

 Reconsider  a decision  
 
This page tells you about when a person who is currently on bail previously had 
leave which was cancelled by an immigration decision , and what to do when that 
decision has been withdrawn and is being reconsidered.  
 
A person may have leave extended by section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971 while 
an in -time application is being considered. At the point their application is decided, 
subject to any appeal rights or right to administrative review, the statutory extension 
of their leave will cease. They will therefore be a person who is liable to detention 
under paragraph 16 of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971.  
 
There are occasions where we withdraw the decision that brought leave extended by 
section 3C to an end. This may be due to representations being made or because 
we agree to reconsider the decision in settling a judicial review. When we withdraw a 
decision, we will usually have to remake it . Where the person previously benefited 
from section 3C, section 3C leave will be resurrected at the point we withdraw the 
decision. That means if the person was on bail you should always bring bail to an 
end. See Ending immigration bail  for further guidance.  
 
For further information on 3C leave, see Leave extended by section 3C (and leave 
extended by Section 3D in transitional cases).

 Ending immigration bail  
 
This page tells you when immigration bail  will end . 
 
When bail is granted, the person remains on bail until it automatically end s, for 
example, where the person is granted leave to enter or remain in the UK, is detained 
under immigration powers, or departs the UK. Leave includes those granted 
restricted leave . 
 
Grant letters contain an optional line with wording to end bail so no further 
notification needs to be provided:  
 
‘Once you have been issued with a Biometric Residence Permit, as specified 
above, your immigration bail will end automatically, in accordance with the 
Immigration (Biometric Registration) Regulations 2008 as amended by the 
Immigration (Biometric Registratio n) (Amendment) Regulations 2012. ’ 
 
Secretary of State granted bail, or bail managed by the Secretary of State  should be 
recorded on Atla s in accordance with the operat ing procedure in your area.  
 
The decision maker must also inform the First -tier Tribunal, if the Tribunal was 
managing the bail and was not involved in it coming to an end.  
 
See Duration of Immigration Bail  for when bail ends.

 Transitional arrangements  
 
This page tells you about the transitional arrangements for pe ople on other forms of 
detention/restrictions prior to the commencement of immigration bail.  
 
Under paragraph 13 of Schedule 10, regulations for commencing the Schedule treat 
people who had already been notified of their liability to detention and given 
restrictions as an alternative to detention ( for example  temporary admission, 
temporary release, release on restrictions and bail) as having been granted 
immigration bail in such circumstances and subject to the same conditions as were 
previously specified to the person.  
 
This applies to the following:  
 
• a person on temporary admission under paragraph 21 of Schedule 2 to the 
Immigration Act 1971  
• a person released from detention under that paragraph  
• a person liable to detention under paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 3 to the 
Immigration Act 1971 but released by virtue of a direction of the Secretary  
• a person liable to be detained under paragraph 2(2) or (3) of that Schedule 
but was not so detained  
• a person released from detention under section 36(3) of the UK Borders Act 
2007  
• a person released on bail from detention under any provision of the 
Immigration Acts  
 
There is no requirement to contact these individuals separately to notify them of their 
transition onto immigration bail. However, when the person is next contacted they 
should be informed that they are now on immigration bail.  
 
Below is the recommended wording for explaining immigration bail to persons who 
have transitioned from their current restriction regime:  
 
‘Following a change in the law, your status in the UK is now described as 
‘immigration bail’. Your presence in the UK was previously subject to restrictions 
or conditions under the Immigration Act 1971. The Immigration Act 2016 has 
replaced these parts of t he Immigration Act 1971. The restrictions on your 
presence in the UK remain the same. ’ 
 
A variation of the pre -existing conditions will need to be updated on Atlas  and a BAIL 
201 form issued to the person.

B E IT ENACTED by the King’s  most  Excellent  Majesty,  by and with  the advice  and 
consent  of the Lords  Spiritual  and Temporal,  and Commons,  in this present 
Parliament  assembled,  and by the authority  of the same,  as follows:— 
Introduction 
1 Introduction 
(1) The purpose  of this Act is to prevent  and deter  unlawful  migration,  and in 
5particular  migration  by unsafe  and illegal  routes,  by requiring  the removal 
from  the United  Kingdom  of certain  persons  who  enter  or arrive  in the United 
Kingdom  in breach  of immigration  control. 
(2) To advance  that purpose,  this Act— 
(a) places  a duty  on the Secretary  of State  to make  arrangements  for the 
10removal  of certain  persons  who  enter  or arrive  in the United  Kingdom 
in breach  of immigration  control  as soon  as is reasonably  practicable 
after  their  entry  or arrival,  subject  only  to the exceptions  specified  by 
or under  this Act; 
(b) provides  for protection  claims  and certain  human  rights  claims  made 
15by persons  who  meet  the conditions  for removal  under  this Act to be 
inadmissible; 
(c) provides  for the detention  of persons  who  are subject  to removal  under 
this Act; 
58/3 Bill 262 1 Illegal  Migration  Bill (d) provides  for protections  and entitlements  to assistance  and support 
which  are available  to victims  of modern  slavery  or human  trafficking 
not to apply  to persons  who  are subject  to removal  under  this Act;

5prevents  persons  who  meet  the conditions  for removal  under  this Act

(as defined  in section  37); 
(h) has the effect  that all other  legal  challenges  to the removal  of persons 
under  this Act do not suspend  the duty  to make  arrangements  for 
their  removal.

15Accordingly,  and so far as it is possible  to do so, provision  made  by or by 
virtue  of this Act must  be read  and given  effect  so as to achieve  the purpose 
mentioned  in subsection  (1). 
(4) In addition,  this Act makes  provision— 
(a) about  the period  for which  persons  may  be detained  in immigration 
detention;

apply  to victims  of modern  slavery  or human  trafficking; 
(c) for asylum  claims  and human  rights  claims  made  by nationals  of 
certain  safe States  to be inadmissible; 
25 (d) for the maximum  number  of persons  who  may  enter  the United 
Kingdom  annually  using  safe and legal  routes  to be specified  in 
regulations  which  are subject  to approval  by Parliament. 
(5) Section  3 of the Human  Rights  Act 1998  (interpretation  of legislation)  does 
not apply  in relation  to provision  made  by or by virtue  of this Act.
